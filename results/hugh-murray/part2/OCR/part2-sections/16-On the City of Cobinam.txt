Cobinam is a great city inhabited by Mohammedans. There is abundance of iron, brass, and andanico, of the second of which they construct large and beautiful mirrors; they make here also the tutty, which is extremely good for the eyes, and likewise sponge, in the following manner. They take a vein of earth fitted for this purpose, and throw it into a burning furnace, above which is a grating of iron; then the smoke and moisture ascending adhere to the iron and form tutty, while the earth which remains in the furnace becomes sponge.
