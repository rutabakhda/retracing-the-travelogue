This is a beautiful, large, and noble city, 500 miles south-west from Escier.The people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and ruled by a count, who is subject to Aden, to which, indeed, this city belongs. The port is very good, and merchants convey thence many very fine Arabian horses, Numerous cities and castles depend upon it, and the country yields much incense. The trees are about the size of a small fir, and incisions are made with knives in various places, whence flows the incense, which, indeed, through the great heat, often runs out of itself. I shall now proceed to relate of the Gulf of Calatu.
