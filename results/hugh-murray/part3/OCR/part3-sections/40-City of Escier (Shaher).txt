Escier is a very large town to the north-west (north), four hundred miles from Aden.A count here rules with justice, but subject to the soldan of Aden ; and the people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed. ‘The port is good, frequented by many ships and merchants from India, who bring various commodities, and carry away others, particularly horses of great value, and yielding large profit. In this province grows a great quantity of fine incense, also of dates.They have no grain except rice, and little of that ; hence corn is profitably imported from other countries, Fish is caught in sach plenty, that for a Venetian gros you may purchase two large tunnies. The people live on rice, flesh, and fish, and have no wine except what they make from sugar, rice, and dates. But I must tell you, too, that they have sheep without ears, or any opening for them ; but where the ears should be, is a little horn; these are small and very beautiful creatures.Another thing you will much wonder at is, that all the animals, sheep, oxen, and camels, eat fish, because there is no grass, for it is the most arid place in the world. These fishes are very small, caught in March, April, and May, in wonderful quantities. They are dried, lodged in houses, and given as food to the animals during the whole year. The people eat them also when quite alive and newly taken. There are also plenty of large ones, which being made into a kind of biscuit, by cutting them into small pieces and drying them in the sun, are preserved under cover during the whole year.* The incense, mentioned as so abundant, is purchased by their lord at ten golden bezants the cantar, and retailed to the merchants for forty, so that he makes a very large profit. Let us now leave this city, and tell you of Dufar.
