This is a great country to the westward. The inhabitants are idolaters, with languages of their own, and @ monarch subject to no other. They are not pirates, but live by trade and industry, as good men ought to do. ‘The country is rich, and frequented by many merchants. The people, however, are fierce and cruel idolaters. Kesmacoran is a kingdom with a sovereign and languages of itsown. The people are idolaters, and raise abundance of rice, on which and on flesh and milk they subsist. There is a great trade by sea and land, but nothing else worth mentioning.Now this is the last province found in India, in proceeding between west and north-west ; and all the kingdoms already described, from Maabar to this, belong to that India which is called the Greater, and is the first of any in the world.
