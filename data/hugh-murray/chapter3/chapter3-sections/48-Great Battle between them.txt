Next day Argon, having made all his arrangements, advanced in good order; while his antagonist, not waiting his arrival, led on his troops to the encounter. They soon met, and the two great hosts, who had much desired the battle, rushed without delay against each other. Arrows flew like rain, chiefs fell to the ground, the air resounded with the cries and lamentations of the wounded and dying. Their arrows being exhausted, they rushed on with swords and spears; arms, hands, and heads were cut off, and the noise would have drowned the loudest thunder, In that day many brave men died, and many ladies were left disconsolate. Argon assuredly displayed great prowess, and set a gallant example ; but in vain,—fortune turned against him,—his men, compelled to flee, were pursued and slain in great numbers.. Among the fugitives, he himself was captured, when the pursuers stopped and returned with him to their camp, rejoicing beyond measure. Acomat caused him to be imprisoned and carefully guarded ; then, being of a voluptuous disposition, he returned to court to enjoy the society of his numerous and handsome wives. He instructed the commander of the host to guard the captive as himself, and return at leisure that his troops might not be fatigued. He then departed, while Argon remained in chains, and so grieved, that death appeared to him desirable.
