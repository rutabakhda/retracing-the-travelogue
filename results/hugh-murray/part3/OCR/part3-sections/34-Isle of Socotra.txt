About 500 miles south from these isles you find that of Scotra, the people of which are baptized Christians, and have an archbishop. Ambergris is very plentiful, being voided from the entrails of whales, which are pursued most actively, in order to obtain this precious article. They strike into the animal a barbed iron 80 firmly that it cannot be drawn out. A long line attached enables them to discover the place where the dead fish lies, and drag it to the shore, when they extract from its belly the ambergris, and from its head several casks of oil.Fine cotton cloth is made; and abundance of good salt fish prepared. The people subsist on rice, milk, and flesh; and go naked after the manner of the other idolatrous Indians. To this island come many ships and merchants ; and indeed all those destined for Aden touch there. The archbishop has no connexion with the See of Rome, but is subject to a primate resident at Bagdad, who appoints him, as well as sends mandates to bishops and prelates in other quarters of the world. Hither, too, repair many corsairs with their ships, to sell their booty, and find a ready market, because the Christians, knowing it to have been abstracted from idolaters and Saracens, scruple not to purchase.  They perform many other marvellous enchantments, which it would be wrong to relate; they would excite such amazement. We shall therefore leave them, and describe the island of Madagascar.
