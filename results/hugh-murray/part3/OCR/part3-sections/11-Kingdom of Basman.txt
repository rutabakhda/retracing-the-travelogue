Leaving Ferlech, you enter Basman,a kingdom by itself, whose people have a language of their own, and live without law, like beasts. They own the supremacy of the khan, but pay him no tribute, because the great distance prevents his troops from reaching them; yet they sometimes make him a present of strange objects. Here are wild elephants, and unicorns not much smaller, being double the size of a buffalo. They have a large black horn in the middle of the forehead, and beneath the tongue sharp prickles, which can inflict severe wounds, Their heads resemble that of the wild boar, yet they carry them bent to the earth. They are very ugly, and fond of wallowing among mire.It is not true, as asserted among us, that they allow themselves to be taken by a virgin, but quite the contrary. There are here good and serviceable falcons, black like crows ; also a prodigious number of monkeys of various forms and habits. But you must know that those who bring the little men from India practise a great deception. I assure you the figures to which they give that name are manufactured in this island in the following manner :— There is a species of small monkey, with a face resembling the human, which they catch, skin, and shave off all the hair except on the beard and chin; having then moulded them intoa human semblance, they dryand preservethem with camphor and other articles. But it is a gross deception ; for neither in India, nor in any other country, however savage, are there men so small as these pretended ones.t Now let us tell of a kingdom called Samara.
