Not long after Argon had gained this battle, he received news of the death of Abaga. He was much grieved, yet prepared with his whole host to return to the court, and take possession of the sovereignty ; but he had forty days to march before arriving there. Nowa brother of the deceased monarch, named Acomat Soldan, who had become a Saracen, having heard of the event, bethought himself, that since the heir was so distant, he himself might succeed. Having prepared a large body of men, he marched directly to the capital, and seized the supreme power. He found such an amount of treasure, that it could scarcely be counted. He lavished his bounty in a wonderful manner on the chiefs and barons, who declared him a good master, liked him, and wished for no other. He studied to be popular, and to please all men; yet the action he had committed was vile, and blamed by many. It was not long till he learned that Argon was marching against him with a very powerful force. He made no delay, nor showed surprise, but actively summoned his barons and troops ; and in a week he had assembled a numerous body of cavalry, who all marched cheerfully against Argon, expressing their earnest desire to kill or take him. Soldan Acomat having thus assembled 60,000 horsemen, set out and marched full ten days without interruption, when he learned that Argon, with an equal force, was five days’ journey distant. He pitched his camp and awaited the enemy in a large and beautiful plain, which seemed well adapted for the combat. He then summoned his people, and thus addressed them :— “ My lords, you know how well I am entitled to succeed my brother, being son of the same father, and having accompanied him in all his conquests. Because Argon is son to Abaga, some think he ought to succeed ; but with all due respect to them, I consider this unjust. Even during my brother’s life, I was reasonably entitled to half the kingdom, only through my mildness I allowed him the whole, but now I ought to succeed. I pray you then to defend my right against Argon, and preserve to us the rule; for I seek only the name and dignity, and leave to you the profit and possession of all. I need say no more to wise men, who love justice, and will do all things for the general honour and benefit.” ‘When the barons, chiefs, and soldiers heard this speech, they declared with one consent their resolution to adhere to him while they had breath, and defend him against all, and particularly Argon, whom they trusted they would capture and place in his hands.  When that prince learned that his rival was waiting for him with so great a multitude, he was much discomposed ; he considered, however, how injurious it would be to show melancholy or fear, and the necessity of displaying valourand boldness. He sent for his lords and counsellors, and having assembled a great number, thus addressed them :—“ My dear brothers and friends, you know well how tenderly my father loved you, regarding you while he lived as kindred and children ; also how many great battles you fought with him, aiding him to conquer all his kingdom. Now I am the son of him who loved you so much, and to me you are equally dear; I therefore trust you will aid me against the man who seeks, contrary to all right and reason, to disinherit me. Consider also, that he has forsaken our law and embraced that of Mohammed ; it were fitting indeed that a Saracen should rule over the Tartar nation! Therefore, friends and brothers, I trust that you will willingly and heartily support me, and that each will display such valour, that the battle may be ours, and we may comfort ourselves by thinking that the right is on our side.” After this speech, each lord and chief thought to himself, that he ought rather to die than not strenuously endeavour to gain atriumph. While the rest were silent, one great lord arose and said :—‘“ Noble sire, we know fully the truth of what you have said, and I will now answer in the name of all now present, that while life remains in our bodies, we are ready to die rather than fail to conquer. Victory, too, appears to us certain, since we are so greatly in the right, and our enemies in the wrong. I advise, then, that we march as soon as possible against the foe, and pray all our companions to display such valour, that their deeds may be spoken of over the whole world.” That brave man having concluded, all present assented, and eagerly desired battle. Next morning, Argon and his troops began their march, riding towards the plain on which their enemies were posted, and pitched their camp ten miles distant from that of Acomat. Argon now chose two intelligent men, in whom he greatly confided, and sent them to his uncle. They mounted on horseback, went direct, and alighted at the pavilion of the soldan, whom they found with a numerous company of barons. Being well acquainted, they saluted him courteously, and received a cheerful welcome. After some time, one of them rose and said,— “Noble sire, your nephew Argon wonders greatly at your seizing his kingdom, and coming thus to fight against him. This is not good conduct, nor due from an uncle towards a nephew; he therefore courteously prays you to abstain, and desiring neither war nor quarrel, will respect you as superior and father, both of himself and of the whole country.” Acomat answered,— ‘My lords messengers, my nephew is entirely mistaken ; the land is mine, I conquered it along with his father. If he will consent, I will make him a great lord, endowing him with spacious estates, treating him as my son and the highest under myself; otherwise, be assured, I will endeavour to put him to death.” The envoys then asked repeatedly, if they could hope for no other determination. He replied, never in his lifetime. They then departed, and rode to the camp of their lord, alighted at the tent, and told him his uncle’s declaration.Argon was greatly enraged, and said aloud in the hearing of all, that he would never live in comfort till the whole world had seen the signal vengeance he would take on his uncle. He said to his chiefs,—“ Now let us without further delay march against these traitors and endeavour to destroy them.” The night was spent in busy preparation ; and Acomat Soldan, being warned by his spies, was equally active.
