Cail is a great and noble city, belonging to Asciar, eldest of the five brother-kings. Its port is frequented by all the ships from the west, Curmos, Quisci, Aden, and the whole of Arabia, laden with merchandise and horses. The merchants bring them hither as to a good market, frequented by purchasers from other quarters.The king possesses immense treasures, and wears many precious stones. He rules his nation very justly and uprightly, for which cause the merchants frequent it, and afford him great profit. He has three hundred wives and upwards, holding it a high honour to increase their number. When discord arises among the five brother-kings, their mother, who is still alive, rushes between them, and will not allow them to fight. Often, when they will not yield to her prayer, and are about to engage, she takes a knife and says, “ If you will not renounce this quarrel, I will kill myself presently, and cut away the paps with which I gave you milk.” When the sons see this great piety in their mother, they feel themselves bound to make peace. But as soon as she is dead, they cannot fail to quarrel and destroy each other.  All the natives here, as well as generally throughout India, have continually in their mouths the leaf called tembul. It affords them gratification, and its use has become quite habitual ; after chewing they spit out the moisture. The rich mix it with camphor and other aromatic drugs, and even with quick-lime. When any one wishes to insult another in the grossest manner, he spits this juice in his face. The injured party then hastens to the king, and declares his wish to decide the quarrel by combat. His majesty furnishes him with a sword and small shield ; and all the people assemble as spectators of the conflict, which is only terminated by the death of one of the parties. They are not, however, allowed to strike with the point of the sword.Now let us depart and tell you of the kingdom of Coilon.
