These people are idolaters, and each person has, for the object of worship, a tablet fixed against an elevated part of the wall of his apartment, having a name written on it which denotes the high, heavenly, and mighty God, and this they daily worship, burning incense before it. Raising their hands, and beating their faces three times against the floor, they entreat from him the blessings of sound understanding and bodily health, addressing no other petition. Below, on the floor, they have a statue named Natigai, considered as the god of terrestrial objects, or of whatever is produced on the earth. They suppose him to have a wife and children, and worship him in the same manner with incense, lifting their hands, and bending to the ground. They pray to him for good weather, plentiful crops, increase of family, and other such objects, They believe the soul to be so far immortal, that immediately after death it enters another body, and according as a man’s actions in this life have been virtuous or wicked, his future state will be progressively more or less fortunate. If he has been poor, yet acted worthily and respectably, he will be born anew, first of a lady, becoming himeelf a gentleman ; then of a woman of rank, becoming a nobleman, and he will continually ascend in the scale of existence till he becomes united with the divinity. Onthe contrary, if a gentleman’s son have acted unworthily, he will, at his next birth, become a clown, and at length a dog ; descending always to a condition more vile than the former.  They converse courteously, accosting each other with politeness and with countenances expressive of pleasure ; they have a well-bred air, and a manner of eating particularly cleanly. The utmost reverence is shown to parents ; and should any child treat his with disrespect, or neglect to assist them, there is a public tribunal having for its especial object to punish the crime of -filial ingratitude. Malefactors, when found guilty, after being apprehended and thrown into prison, are strangled ; but such as remain till the expiry of three years, a time appointed by his majesty for a general release, are set at liberty, having however a brand fixed on one of the cheeks, by which they may be recognised.  The great khan has prohibited all gambling and other species of fraud, to which this people are addicted beyond any other upon earth; and as a reason for this prohibition, he tells them in his edict, “ I subdued you by the power of my sword, and consequently whatever you possess belongs of right to me; in gambling, therefore, you sport with my property.” Yet he does not, by the right thus claimed, take any thing on an arbitrary principle. The orderly and regular manner in which all ranks present themselves before him deserves notice. On approaching within half a mile of his residence, they testify their reverence for his exalted rank by an humble, subdued, and quiet demeanour, so that not the least noise is heard, nor does any one call, or even speak aloud. Every man of rank carries with him, while he continues in the hall of audience, a vessel into which he spits, that he may not soil the floor; and having done so, he replaces the cover, and makes a bow. They usually take with them handsome buskins of white leather, and on reaching the court, before entering the hall, where they wait to be summoned by his majesty, put them on, giving those worn in walking to the care of the servants. This precaution is taken that they may not sully the beautiful carpets, curiously wrought with silk and gold, and exhibiting a variety of colours.
