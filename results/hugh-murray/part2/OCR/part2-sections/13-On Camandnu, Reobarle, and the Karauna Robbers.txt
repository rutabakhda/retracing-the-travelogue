At the bottom of this descent is a very extensive plain, at the commencement of which is a city named Camandu,once wonderfully great and noble, but now much declined, because the Tartar invaders have repeatedly plundered it. The heat here is extreme, and the province is called Reobarle.Its fruits are dates, pistachio nuts, apples of paradise, and others which do not grow in our country. Here are a species of birds called francolin, which are different from those of other lands, their colour being a mixture of white and black, while the beak and feet are red. The oxen are very large, white as snow, and the hair very smooth, in consequence of the heat. Between the shouldersis a hump, two palms high, and their appearance is the most beautiful of any in the world. When the owner wishes to load them, they bend down as the camels do, and after receiving their burden, rise and bear it well, being extremely strong. There are sheep as large as asses, and with tails so thick and so broad as to weigh full thirty pounds. They are also fat, and make excellent food.The people have castles and cities surrounded by walls of earth, in order to defend themselves against the Caraunas, a mixed race between the Indians and the Tartars. When these people wish to overrun the country and rob it, they, by their enchantment and diabolical agency, cause the day to become dark, so that you can see to little or no distance, and this darkness they make to last seven days.They know the places so well, that they can ride during the thickest of it ; and they are sometimes ten thousand in number, so that nothing found on the plain, man, beast, or any thing, can escape. They kill the old persons, and carry off the young to sell them for slaves. Their king is called Nogodar, and he went to the court of Ciagatai, who was the brother of the great khan, with 10,000 men, and remained with him, because his uncle was very powerful. During this stay, Nogodar committed a very great wickedness, and I will tell you what it was. He departed from his uncle Ciagatai, who was in Great Armenia, and took with him 10,000 of his people, who were very cruel, and marched by Badasian and through a province called Pasciai, and another called Chesciemur, losing many of his people and beasts, because the roads were narrow and very bad; and when they had passed all these provinces, they entered into India, on the borders of one called Dilivar. They came to the city of the same name, and took it from a king called Asidiu Sultan, who was very great and rich. There Nogodar, with his people, continues to rule, and makes war with all the other Tartars who dwell in the surrounding country.Having told you of this plain, and of the people who produced darkness in order to rob, I must also mention that Messer Marco himself was nearly taken by them amid this gloom, but though a number of his companions were captured, and either killed or sold as slaves, he himself escaped to a castle named Canosalmi.
