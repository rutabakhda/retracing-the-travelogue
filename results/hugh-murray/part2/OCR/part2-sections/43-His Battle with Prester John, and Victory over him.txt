When Gengis Khan heard this boastful speech, his heart swelled, so that it almost burst within him ; for you must know he was a man of very great pride. He then said to his minister, and to all about him, that he would not continue to hold the sovereignty, unless Prester John were made to pay more dearly for this villany than ever man did, and he must soon be made to see whether he was his vassal. Then he summoned round him the greatest army that ever was seen or heard of, and sent notice to Unchan that he must defend himself, as he was coming against him. When that prince knew certainly the approach of Gengis with so great a force, he made light of it, saying, they were not men-at-arms ; yet. resolved that should he approach, he would do all in his power to take and put him todeath. He then ordered all his people to be prepared and summoned from many and strange parts,and a greater host and of more formidable aspect was never seen. And why make a long story! The khan, with all his people, came to a great and beautiful plain, named Tenduc, in Prester John’s country, where he pitched his camp, and rejoiced greatly to hear that his enemy was coming, because it was an excellent situation for giving battle. He sent for his astrologers, who were Christian and Saracen, and required to know which would conquer in that battle, he or his antagonist. The latter could tell nothing of the truth ; but the former showed it openly; for they brought before him a cane, cut in the middle, and placed the two parts on different sides, and wrote the name of Gengis on one, and of Unchan on the other, telling him, that when they had made their enchantment, he whose cane should come above that of the other would conquer in battle. He desired that this should be shown to him as soon as possible. Then they took up the Psaltery, read certain portions, and performed their enchantment, when presently the cane on which was the name of Gengis, without any one touching it, joined the other, and mounted above it, and this was witnessed by all present. When he saw this, he was greatly rejoiced, and seeing that the Christians were men of truth, held them always in great honour. Two days after, the armies engaged, and it was the greatest battle that ever was fought. The slaughter was terrible on both sides; but at length Gengis conquered, his enemy was slain in the engagement, and he himself became master of all his land. From that day he went on conquering many castles and provinces, and reigned six years ; but, at the end of that time, he besieged a fort, named Cangui, where he was wounded in the knee by an arrow, and died. This was a great misfortune, for he was a brave and wise man.
