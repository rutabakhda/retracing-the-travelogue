Now since I have begun speaking of the Tartars, I will tell you many thingsabout them. They abide during winter in plains and warm situations, where there is abundant herbage for their cattle; and in summer they retire to cool places on mountains and high valleys, where water abounds. They have wooden houses covered with felt, of a round shape, which they convey with them wherever they go; for they have them so well bound with twigs as to be easily carried. Whenever they take down and set up a house, the gate is always placed to the south. They have waggons so well covered with black felt, that if it should rain the whole day, no water would reach any thing within ; and they are drawn by oxen and camels. On the top they place their wives and children ; and I must tell you that the ladies buy, sell, and perform all the work necessary for their husbands, who do nothing but hunt, hawk, and go to war. They live on flesh, milk, and the produce of hunting, and likewise on rats of Pharaoh, which are found here in great numbers.They eat also the flesh of camels, dogs, and indeed of every kind of animal, and drink mare’s milk. They shun the seduction of married females, as a most vile and shameful thing; and the wives are very faithful, performing extremely well the business of the household. Every man may take as many as he pleases, even to a hundred, if he can maintain them ; yet they hold the first as the principal and most respectable. They scruple not to marry their cousins, and if the father dies, the eldest son may take all his wives, except his own mother ; he marries also the widow of his deceased brother. They celebrate their marriages by great festivals. The Tartars, who believe in a deity of a sublime and heavenly nature, burn incense in censers to him, and pray that he may preserve them in health of mind and body. They have also one called Nacygai, whom they call their earthly god, who guards their children, cattle, and corn, They fashion him of felt and cloth, keep him in their house, and pay him great honour and reverence. They make for him also a wife and children of cloth, placing the first on his left hand, and the latter in front. Before eating, they take the fat meat and anoint his mouth with it; then lay bread before the door of his chamber. Having done this, they say that their god and his family have had their share, and sit down to their own meals, I told you that they drink mare’s milk, but it is in such a manner that it seems white wine, being of an agreeable taste, and called chemius. The wealthy wear rich robes of gold and silk, with varied furs of the ermine, sable, and fox. Their harness is beautiful and of great value; their arms are bows, swords, and clubs ; but the first is more used than the others, because they are excellent archers. On their back they wear armour of buffalo and other very strong hides.  I will tell you the manner in which they maintain justice. If a man has stolen an article of little value, they give him seven lashes, or seventeen, or twentyseven, going on thus always to three hundred and seven, and many die under them. If he steals a horse or any thing else for which he deserves to die, he is cut through the middle with a sword; yet if he can pay nine times the value of what he has stolen, he is allowed to live. Every lord or other man, who owns oxen or any cattle, makes them be marked with his seal, and then allows them to feed on the plains or among the mountains ; and whoever finds one straying brings it to him whose mark is upon it. The sheep and lambs, however, are guarded by ashepherd. Their cattle are all remarkably large, fat, and beautiful. They have another wonderful custom which I had forgot; for when two men have one a son, the other a daughter, dead at the age of four, they marry them together, and represent the union by cards, which they set on fire, and when they see the flame and smoke ascending, they make great shouts and run backward and forward, saying that the dead are going to their children in the other world, and are to be husband and wife there. They do more, for they paint on cards the similitudes of men, horses, cloths, bezants, and harness, then burn them, and say that all these things will be possessed by their children in the other world.
