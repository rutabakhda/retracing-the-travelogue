Sa-yan-fu isa large and magnificent city, having under it twelve others also great and noble; it is the seat of many valuable arts and of much merchandize.	  The inhabitants are idolaters; they use paper money, are subject to the khan, and burn the bodies of their dead. This city held out three years after all the rest of the province had yielded to the conqueror, who besieged it with a mighty army ; but he could approach it only on the side which lies to the north, because it was elsewhere surrounded by a large and deep lake, by which the besieged obtained abundance of provisions, The army was therefore about to abandon the siege in much grief and wrath, and this news was just brought to the khan, when Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco Polo said, —‘ we shall find a way by which the city shall be made to surrender.” The monarch, who was most eagerly bent on its capture, readily listened. Then said the two brothers and their son Marco,—“ Great sire, we have with us in our train men who will make such an engine as will discharge large stones, which the citizens will not be able to endure, and will be obliged.to yield.” The khan was much rejoiced, and desired that they should execute their plan as soon as possible. Now, they had in their company aGerman and a Nestorian Christian who were skilful in such works, and made two or three machines sufficient to throw stones of 300 pounds weight. When these were conveyed to the army and set up, they appeared to the Tartars the greatest wonder of the world. They then began discharging stones into the city, which struck the houses, broke and destroyed every thing, and caused the utmost noise and alarm. When the inhabitants saw a calamity such as they had never witnessed before, they knew not what to think or say. They met in council, and concluded that they must be all killed, unless they submitted. They therefore intimated to the lord of the host that they would surrender on the same terms that others had done. This was agreed to, and Sa-yan-fu came under the power of the great khan, through the interposition of Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco ; and it was not a small service, for this town and province are among the best in his possession, and he draws from them a great revenue.Now, we shall leave this subject and treat of a city called Sin-gui.
