This kingdom has a language of its own; the people are very savage, subject to a king, but owning the supremacy of the great khan.They are savage idolaters, and have the following very bad custom :—When a man falls sick, his relations send for the magicians, and inquire if he will recover, as these deceivers profess to know, by their enchantments and idols, whether he will live or die. Inthe latter case, the friends send for persons who place something over hismouth, by which he is suffocated. They then cook the body, and all the kinsmen come and eat his flesh, taking care not to leave the smallest portion; which they believe would breed worms, and thus seriously afflict the soul of the deceased. They next collect the bones, and place them in a large and beautiful chest, which they carry to caverns in the mountains, beyond the reach of wild beasts or any other injury. When they take any man belonging to another country, who cannot redeem himself, they kill and eat him in like manner. This is a very bad practice.I must now, however, tell you something of Lambri.
