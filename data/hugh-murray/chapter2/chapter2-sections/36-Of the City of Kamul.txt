Kamult is a province, formerly a kingdom, containing cities and castles, with a capital of the same name. It stands between two deserts, the great one already described, and a smaller one, extending three days’ journey. | The people are all idolaters, and have a peculiar language ; they live by the fruits of the earth, having enough to eat, and also to sell to the passenger. They are men of great gaiety, thinking of nothing but to sound musical instruments, to sing, dance, and delight their hearts, When a stranger comes to lodge in a house, the master is highly pleased, and leaves him with his wife, desiring her to treat him in every respect as a husband, while he himself goes and spends two or three days elsewhere. All the men of the province proceed in this manner, and do not account it any disgrace. The women are handsome, gay, and fond of diversion. Now, when Mangou Khan reigned as sire of the Tartars, it was reported to him how the people of Kamul gave over their wives to strangers, when he sent orders that, under a severe penalty, travellers should not be henceforth entertained in this manner. When they received this injunction, they were greatly grieved, held a council, and did what I will now tell you. They made up a large present, and sent it to Mangou, praying that he would allow them to treat their wives according to the custom handed down to them by their ancestors, who, for this kindness to strangers, had gained the favour of their idols, and their corn and other crops had greatly multiplied. When he heard this message, he said, “Since you are so bent on your own shame, let it be so.” He allowed them, therefore, to do as they pleased, and hence they have always maintained this custom.
