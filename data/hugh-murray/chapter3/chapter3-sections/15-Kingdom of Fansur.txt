The people of Fansur are idolaters, have a king, and nominally acknowledge the great khan.

Wine is drawn from trees, in the manner described above : another wonder is, that, in this province, meal is obtained from them. These are large, the bark thin, and the interior all full of meal. The inhabitants take it out, and make a very good paste, of which we often ate.Having told you of the kingdoms in this part of the isle, I will say nothing of the two others, because we did not. visit them. I will now, therefore, go to another small island called Gavenispola.
