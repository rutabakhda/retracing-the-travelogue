Ginghintalas is a province which is near the desert, between north and south, sixteen days’ journey in extent, and subject to the great khan. It contains cities, castles, and three descriptions of men, idolaters, adorers . of Mohammed, and Nestorian Christians. On the borders of it, towards the north, is a mountain containing a very abundant vein of copper and antimony. There is also one from which is made the salamander; but do not suppose this is the animal so called, for no creature can live in fire, because it is compounded of the four elements. It is only through ignorance that the salamander is called an animal ; and a Turk, named Zurficar, who was very learned, and governor of this province for three years under the great khan, being much employed in working the mines, gave me an account of it. When this ore is taken from the mountain, and is broken, it strings together, and forms a thread like wool. Being then dried, pounded in a large mortar, and washed, there remains that thread of which I have spoken. Being then woven like wool, it forms cloth, which is dingy in colour at first, but when placed and left some time in the fire, it becomes white as snow, without dirt or stain. This is the truth of the salamander, and every thing else said about itis mere fable.I can tell you, too, that at Rome there is a cloth which the great khan sent to the pope as a costly present, and the sudarium of our Lord was placed within it. Now let us tell you of other provinces to the south-east and east.
