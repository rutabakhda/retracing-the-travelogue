Armenia the Greater§ is a large country, and, at the entrance of it isa city called Arzinga, in which is made the best buckram in the world. There are several baths of warm spring water, the best and most beautiful any where to be found. There are many castles, and cities, among which the noblest is Arzinga, the seat of an archbishop, and the metropolis of the whole district; there are also Argiron and Darzizi.I assure you the province is very large, and during the summer all the Tartars of the Levant reside here with their flocks and herds, on account of its rich pastures ; but in winter they cannot remain because of the severe cold and snow, amid which the animals could not live. Now, in this Armenia is the ark of Noah on a great mountain.The circuit of its base cannot be traversed in less than two days ; and the ascent is rendered impracticable by the snow on its summit, which never dissolves, but is increased by each successive fall. On the lower declivities, the melted snows cause an abundant vegetation, and afford rich pastures for the cattle which in summer resort thither from all the surrounding -countries. To the south-east it borders on a kingdom called Mosul, inhabited by Jacobite and Nestorian Christians, of whom we will mention more hereafter. On the north’ it extends to the Georgians, and on that frontier is a fountain whence rises oil in such abundance that a hundred ships might be at once loaded with it. It is not good for eating, but very fit for fuel, for anointing the camels in maladies of the skin, and for other purposes ; for which reason people come from a great distance for it, and nothing else is burned in all this country.Now let us quit Armenia, and tell of Georgia.
