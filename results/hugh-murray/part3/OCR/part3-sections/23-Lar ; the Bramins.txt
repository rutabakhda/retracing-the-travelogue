Lar is a province lying westward of this place, and thence came originally all the Abraiamain in the world. These are the best and most honest of all merchants, and would not on any account tell a lie.They neither eat flesh nor drink wine, are faithful to their wives, and lead every way very virtuous lives. They take nothing from any one, and do nothing that could be considered a sin.They are all known by a silk thread worn over the shoulder, and tied beneath the opposite arm, so that it passes across both the breast and back.t They have arich king, who readily purchases precious stones, and enjoins that the merchants shall offer to him all the pearls brought from Maabar, for which he pays double the cost. They therefore procure them in large quantities. Theyare idolaters,and regard omens from birds and beasts more than any other nation in the world. I will tell you one of their customs: when one wishes to treat for any merchandise, he rises and observes his shadow in the sun ; and if it be of the due length, on that day, according to certain rules, he makes his bargain ; but if it be not long enough, he will not buy a single article. If they go to a house for this purpose, and see one of the animals named tarantula, which here greatly abound, they observe if it comes to them from a lucky quarter, in which case they buy ; but if otherwise, they give up the transaction and go away. Nay, I assure you, if one leaving his house hears a man sneeze in a manner that does not appear lucky, he stops and re-enters, Even if on his road he sees a swallow approaching from the right or left, in an unlucky manner, he returns.Their teeth are very good, through the use of an herb, which makes them look extremely well, and is very salutary.They never bleed from the vein or any other part, yet perfectly preserve their health. There are among them an order named cuigui, who live to an extraordinary age, even 150 or 200 years, yet can perform all the service of the monastery and idols as well as younger men. This is owing to their great abstinence in eating and drinking ; for they subsist mostly on rice and milk. They mingle also quicksilver and sulphur, making a beverage which they drink from their infancy, saying that it lengthens their lives.t There is also in this kingdom a religious order of more rigid cuigui, observing the strictest abstinence, leading a very rude and severe life, and going perfectly naked. They adore the ox, and many wear on their forehead a small effigy of one in copper or bronze gilded. They also burn the dung, and reduce it to a powder, with which they reverentially anoint many parts of their body, as Christians use holy water. They eat neither from spoon nor platter, but from large leaves, mostly of the apple of paradise. Even these must be dry ; for if green, they are said to have a soul, which it would be sin to kill; and they would rather die than commit towards any animal an action believed unlawful. When asked why they feel no shame in going naked, they say, because they wish to have nothing belonging to this world, which they entered without clothing ; and committing no sin, they have no reason to be ashamed. Besides, they kill no living creature, neither fly nor flea, nor hog nor worm, considering they have souls. They will sleep on the earth without any covering, whence it is a great wonder they do not die, much more that they enjoy so long a life. They fast the whole year round, drinking only water.Some reside in the monastery to serve the gods; but before admission they undergo the following trial. The young girls offered to the idols caress these new candidates, and endeavour variously to entertain them. Such as appear to take any pleasure in these endearments, are rejected as unworthy ; but if they show themselves totally indifferent, they are then retained.Such are the customs of these cruel and perfidious idolaters, who burn the bodies of their dead, because otherwise they would breed worms, which after eating the flesh would starve, and thus involve in great sin the soul to which the body belonged. But I willnow cease saying any more about them.
