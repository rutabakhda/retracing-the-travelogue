Tana is a great kingdom in the west ; the inhabitants idolaters, with a language of their own, under a sovereign subject to no other. It does not produce pepper, or such spices as the other provinces ; but yields incense, not white, but of a brown colour.t There is a great trade in leather finely dressed, also in good cotton, both raw and made into cloth. The merchants import gold, silver, brass, and other goods necessary for these kingdoms, receiving various articles in return. But I have a bad thing to tell you ; for many pirates issue hence, scouring the sea, and greatly injuring the sailors; and the king sanctions their conduct, having made an agreement, that they bring to him all the horses captured, which are very numerous, being in great request over all India. But gold, silver, precious stones, and the rest of the cargo, belong to themselves. Now this is bad and very unjust conduct. Let us leave this country and speak of Cambaia.
