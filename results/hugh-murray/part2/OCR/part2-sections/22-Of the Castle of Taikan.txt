When a man has rode these two days, he finds a castle called Taikan,where there is a great corn-market, and the country round is fine. The mountains towards the south are very high, and formed entirely of salt, which is the best in the world, and people come for it from a distance of thirty days’ journey round. It is so hard, that it can be broken only by great iron hammers ; and there is enough to supply the whole human race till the end of time. Departing from that city, you go three days north-east, through a fine country, well planted with grain and fruits. The people, who are followers of Mohammed, are wicked and murderous. They spend much time in the tavern, for they have abundance of good wine, well prepared. They wear nothing on their heads but a cord ten palms long wrapt round it. They are good hunters, and thus supply themselves with venison ; but have no clothing except the skins of animals.
