This country is subject to a lord, called sultan. The people are all Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and wishing the greatest mischief to Christians. ‘There are many cities and castles; for Aden is the port to which the Indian ships bring all their merchandise. It is then placed on board other small vessels, which ascend a river about seven days, at the end of which it is disembarked, laden on camels, and conveyed thirty days farther. It then comes to the river of Alexandria, and is conveyed down to that city. By this route alone its inhabitants receive their pepper, spices, and costly goods.* From Aden, too, ships sail for India with various goods, especially very fine and valuable horses, which, as you know, are sold there for full a hundred marks of silver. The sultan draws a great revenue from the duties on these cargoes ; and is thus one of the richest princes in the world. But, I assure you, he did great injury to the Christians ; for when the governor of Babylonia attacked and took the city of Acre, committing much devastation, he was assisted by this prince with 30,000 horses and 40,000 camels. This aid was given rather out of hatred to believers than good-will to that prince.But now I will tell you of another great city.
