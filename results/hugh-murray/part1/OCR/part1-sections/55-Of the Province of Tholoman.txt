Tholomant is a third province towards the east. All the - people are idolaters, have a language of their own, and are under the great khan. They are handsome, of rather a brown complexion, good men at arms, and have a number of cities, castles, and forts, on the top of very high mountains. When they die, the bodies are burned, and the bones which cannot be consumed are placed in chests and carried to the caverns of high mountains, where they are kept suspended, so that neither man nor beast can touch them. Gold is found here ; but the small money is of porcelain, which circulates in all these provinces. The merchants, though few, are rich ; the people live on flesh and rice, and have many good spices.
