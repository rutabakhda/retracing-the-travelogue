Cascar was anciently a kingdom, but is now under the dominion of the great khan. The people adore Mohammed, and have cities and castles; they are situated between the north and east. They subsist by merchandise and manufactures, having also fine gardens, vineyards, and orchards, with a good supply of silk. The merchants, in carrying on their trade, go round the whole world ; but they are sordid and covetous, eating and drinking very poorly. Some Nestorian Christians reside here, observing their own customs and laws. The people have a language of their own ; and the province extends five days’ journey.Now let us leave it and speak of Samarcan.
