On the appointed day Alau rose early, summoned his men to arms, and ranged them very skilfully in order of battle. He formed thirty squadrons, each containing 10,000 horsemen, making in all the number of 300,000, with able leaders and captains. By his order his squadrons then advanced at a moderate pace over the plain, till they arrived mid-way between the two camps, where they stopped and awaited the enemy. On the same morning, Barka similarly arranged his men, forming thirty-five squadrons of 10,000 each, with good officers and commanders. He then made his troops ride forward to within half a mile of the enemy, when they halted, and again proceeded till the hosts, being within two bow-shots of each other, stopped and arranged their squadrons. The plain was the largest and finest in all that country ; which, assuredly, was very necessary to afford a field of battle for such mighty armies, amounting to 650,000 men. Indeed Alau and Barka were the most powerful princes in the world, and were near relations too,—being both of the imperial lineage of Gengis Khan.  The two great kings with all their troops being thus marshalled, impatiently waited for the naccar as a signal of battle. When it sounded, the armies rushed forward and discharged arrows against each other. The air was filled, and the sky became invisible; numbers of men and horses fell to the earth, which was covered with dead and dying. The arrows being exhausted, they struck dreadful blows with swords and spears ; assuredly there had not for a long time been a battle in the world fought by such numerous armies. Alau, most brave and powerful in arms, showed himself this day worthy of ruling a kingdom and wearing a crown. He displayed signal prowess in his own person, and by his example infused extraordinary courage into his men. His achievements, indeed, astonished both friends and enemies ; he appeared, not aman, but thunder and tempest. Barka, too, fought most bravely, and made himeelf worthy of the admiration of the whole world ; but it was all in vain ; his men were either killed, or so overwhelmed and exhausted, that they could endure no longer. When evening arrived, they fied with their utmost speed. The victor and his troops rapidly pursued, and after committing dreadful slaughter returned, threw aside their arms, and had their wounds washed and dressed. They were, indeed, quite overpowered and exhausted. The night was spent in repose, and next day he ordered all the dead bodies both of friends and enemies to be burned. He then returned into his country with all the troops who survived the battle; for I assure you, although he conquered, he had lost a vast number, yet still more had fallen on the opposite side. Having told you thus of Alau and his victory, we shall go on to treat of a battle between the Tartars of the west.
