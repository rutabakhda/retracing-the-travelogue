Gozurat, too, is a great kingdom to the west, having languages and a king of its own, and subject to no other. Here the north-star rises to the apparent height of six cubits. The greatest pirates in the world live here, and have a most wicked custom ; after taking a merchant, they make him drink tamarinds and sea-water, then examine carefully if he voids any pearls or precious stones, which are alleged to be usually swallowed on such emergencies.There is in this land a great quantity of pepper and indigo, with a good deal of ginger. Cotton also abounds, and the trees which bear it, when twenty years old, rise to the height of six paces; but the produce is then unfit to be spun, and can only be used for quilting. Before twelve years, it is well fitted for the former purpose.t An immense quantity of "dressed leather is prepared from the skins of the goat, the buffalo, the wild ox, unicorn, and various other animals, and it is largely exported to Arabia and adjoining regions. Coverlets of red leather are also framed, with representations of birds and beasts, most delicately interwoven with gold and silver thread. They are wonderfally beautiful, and being used by the Saracens for sleeping upon, are worth ten mares of silver. There are also cushions woven with gold, valued atten marcs. In short, this leather is embroidered for royal use, more delicately than in any other part of the world.
