This King Facfur maintained 15,000 poor children, because in that province many areexposed as soon as they are born by parents who cannot support them; so, when a rich man had no issue, he went to the king and got asmany as he pleased. And when the boys and girls came of age, the king married them together, and gave them the means of living ; and thus were educated 20,000 males or females annually. He did another thing : when he went through any place and saw two fine houses, and by the side of them a small one, he inquired why the first were greater than the other ; and being told that it be longed to a poor man, who could not afford to build one larger, presently he gave him money enough to enable him to do so, He made himself be served by more than 1000 domestic servants of both sexes. He maintained his kingdom in such justice, that no evil was done, and all commodities could be left unguarded except by the royal equity. Now I have given you an account of the king ; I will tell you of the queen. She was led to the great khan, who made her be honoured and served asa powerful sovereign ; but the king, her husband, never came out of the islands of the ocean, and died there, and thus the whole kingdom remained with the khan.Now let us tell of the province of Manji, and the manners and customs of the people ; beginning with the city of Koi-gan-zu.
