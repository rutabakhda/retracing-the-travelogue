Departing from Java and the kingdom of Lambri, and travelling northward about 150 miles, you find two islands, one of which is called Necuveran.t The people have no king, and live like brutes, both men and women going quite naked. They are idolaters, and have forests of noble and valuable trees ; among which are sandal-wood, the Indian nut, clove, brazil, and many others.  Angaman is a very large island, without a king; the people idolaters, resembling savage beasts; indeed they are a most extraordinary race, having a head, teeth, and jaws like those of a mastiff dog. They are very cruel, and eat all the men of every other nation whom they can seize.They have great abundance and variety of spices, with fruits different from ours, but live chiefly on flesh and milk. Having told of these various people, I will now mention another island.
