Comari is a country of India, remarkable in this respect, that the north-star, which we had not seen since leaving Java, appeared to us when thirty miles out at sea, rising about a cubit above the horizon.

There are cats of a very peculiar and wonderful species, lions, leopards, and ounces in great numbers.I will now proceed to Eli.
