Fu-gui,§ as just stated, is the capital of the kingdom of Con-cha, which is one of the nine parts of Manji. In that city is much merchandise and art ; the people are idolatrous, and subject to the great khan. He keeps there a strong army, because the towns and castles often revolt, and whenever they do so the troops hasten thither, take. and destroy them. Through the middle of that city flows a river a mile broad; here much sugar is made, and an extensive trade is carried on in precious atones and pearls, which are brought by merchants from India and its isles. It is also near the port of Zai-tun on the ocean, whither come many ships from Hindostan with much merchandise ; and they ascend by the great river to Fu-gui. The people have abundance of all things necessary for subsistence ; fine gardens, with good fruit ; and the city is wonderfully well ordered in all respects. But we will now go on to other matters.
