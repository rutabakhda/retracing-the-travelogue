In Turcomania are three distinct races of men :—The Turcomans adore Mohammed, and are simple people, speaking a very rude language. They live amid mountains and valleys where there is good pasturage for cattle, by which they subsist ; and I assure you that they rear excellent horses and mules of great value. . The two others are Armenians and Greeks, who dwell iningled in cities, and subsist by merchandise and manufactures ; they work carpets and crimson silk, the richest and most beautiful in the whole world. They have many towns, of which the principal are Como, Casserie, and Sevasto.	 They are subject to the Eastern Tartars. Now, let us leave them, and speak of Armenia the Greater.
