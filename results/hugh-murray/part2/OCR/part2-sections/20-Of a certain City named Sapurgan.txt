When a man departs from that castle, he rides through beautiful hills covered with rich herbage, with fruits and all things in great abundance. The country extends to a journey of six days, and contains cities the inhabitants of which adore Mohammed. Yet sometimes yau find a desert of fifty or sixty miles, without water, which men must carry with them. When the traveller has rode six days through the country now described, he finds a city called Sapurgan.It has great abundance of all things, among which are the finest melons in the world in great plenty, and they are preserved in this manner: The people cut them all round like cucumbers, and dry them in the sun, when they become sweeter than honey, and are sold through all the country. Here is fine hunting of beasts and birds. Now I will go on to another city named Balk.
