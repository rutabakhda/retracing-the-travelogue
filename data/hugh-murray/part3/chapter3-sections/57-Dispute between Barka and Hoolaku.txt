You must know that about the year 1261 there arose a great discord between these two monarchs. It was about a province on their respective frontier which each desired and would not yield, but resolved to seize it and see who would oppose him. Thereupon they declared war, summoned their respective subjects, and made the greatest preparation almost ever known. I assure you, in six months each had assembled full 300,000 horsemen, well provided with every warlike implement. Alau, lord of the East, then set out with all his troops, and having rode many days, reached a wide plain between the Iron Gates and the Sea of Sarain. There he pitched his camp, which, I have heard, contained many rich tents, and made a splendid appearance. Being here on the frontier, he resolved to wait, and see if Barka would come. That prince having completed his preparations, and learned the approach of his foe, without delay began his march. He rode on till he came to the great plain where his enemy was posted, and pitched his camp at ten miles’ distance. I declare to you, it was fully as beautiful as that of Alau, filled with tents and pavilions of cloth of gold. His army, too, was more numerous, amounting, without a lie, to 350,000 horsemen.They rested two days in their tents, when Barka thus addressed his men :—“ Noble chiefs, you know how, since coming to the sovereignty, I have loved you as brothers and sons; you have accompanied me in many great battles, and aided in conquering much territory. Alau, a great and powerful prince, proposes wrongfully to fight against us; but having the right on our side, we may confidently expect to conquer, especially since our army is more numerous. In this confidence, then, noble chiefs, and having come so far for battle, let us prepare in three days to engage, arranging so wisely, and displaying such valour, that our fame may spread over the world.” He was then silent ; and we must now return to his antagonist, who, when he heard of his adversary’s arrival with so great an army, assembled his principal men and said :—“ Noble brethren and friends, you have throughout all my life supported and aided me, enabling me to conquer in many battles; nor indeed ever fighting one in which we were not victorious. We have come here to combat the great Barka, who indeed has as many and even more troops ; but ours are braver, and I feel confident of victory. I rejoice, then, to hear by the spies, that he is coming to give us battle in three days, and I expect every one to be well prepared, with his accustomed bravery, rather to die on the field with honour, than to suffer disgrace and discomfiture.”
