When the monarch comes to his chief city, he remains in his noble palace three days and no more, when he holds a great court, making high festival and Tejoicing with his ladies. There is a vast abundance of people through all the suburbs of Kambalu, which are twelve in number, one corresponding to each gate ; no one can count the number of residents ; and they contain as stately edifices as any in the city, except the king’s Palace. No one is allowed to be buried within the city ; and no females of bad character can reside there, but must have their dwellings in the suburbs, where there are said to be no fewer than 20,000. There are brought also to Kambalu the most costly articles in the world, the finest productions of India, as precious stones and pearls, with all the produce of Cathay and the surrounding countries, in order to supply the lords and the barons and ladies who reside there. Numerous merchants, likewise, bring more than a thousand wagons laden with grain; and all who are within a hundred miles of the city come thither to purchase what they want.
