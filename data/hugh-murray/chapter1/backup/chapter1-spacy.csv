1	1	PART 1	1	Power and Magnificence of Kublai	That name is assuredly well merited, since he is the most powerful in people, in lands, and in treasure, that is, or ever was, from the creation of Adam to the present day ; 		
2	1	PART 1	1	Power and Magnificence of Kublai	Whosoever descends in the direct line from Gengis is entitled to be master of all the Tartars, and Kublai is the sixth great khan.		Gengis ,Tartars ,Kublai

8	1	PART 1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	You must understand that a certain cousin of his, named Nayan, who, like his ancestors, was his vassal, yet had many lands and provinces of his own, and could raise 400,000 horsemen, being thirty years old,refused to remain longer in subjection, and assumed the whole sovereignty to himself.		
9	1	PART 1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	He sent to a certain great lord, named Kaidu, a nephew of that monarch, but in rebellion against him, and desirous of doing him the greatest injury.		Kaidu

13					and those two assembled a mighty army on horseback and foot, and marched against the great khan.		
14	1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	When Kublai learned these things, he was not at all alarmed, but declared, that he wished he might never wear a crown, nor hold sway over a kingdom, if he did not bring the traitors to an evil death.		
15	1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	He therefore made his whole army be prepared in twenty-two days, and so secretly, that nothing was known beyond his own council.		
16	1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	He raised full 360,000 mounted soldiers, and 100,000 infantry ;		
17					and the reason of their number not being greater, was, that they consisted only of his huntsmen, and those immediately round his person, the rest being employed in carrying on distant wars ;		
18					 for if he could have assembled his whole host, the multitude would have been such as no man could have numbered.		
19	1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	He then called his astrologers, and asked of them if he would be victorious ; 		
20					they answered, that he would do to his enemies according to his pleasure.		
21	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	The great khan having assembled these forces, took his departure, and in twenty days came to a vast plain, where Nayan had assembled all his troops, amounting to 400,000 warriors.		Nayan
22	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	The khan took much care to scour the paths, and intercept all who could have carried the intelligence ; 		
23					so that when he approached at dawn of day, the rebel was lying asleep in bed with a favourite wife, not having the least dread of his arrival, and, consequently, no guard on any side of the camp.		
24	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	Kublai then advanced, having a tower fixed upon four elephants, whereon were placed his ensigns, so that he could be seen by the whole army.		
25	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	His men, divided into bands of twenty thousand, surrounded in a moment the adverse force, each soldier having a footman on the crupper behind him, with a bow in his hand.		
26	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	When Nayan and his men saw their camp thus encircled by the khan and his host, they were seized with amaze ; 		
27					yet they ran to arms, formed themselves in order of battle, and were soon prepared to strike.		
28	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	Then began the beating on many instruments, and singing with loud voices;		
29					 for it is the custom of the Tartars, that until the horn termed naccar is winded the troops do not engage.		Tartars
30	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	But when that grand trumpet of the great khan was sounded, all the other performers began playing, and raising their voices very loud, making a noise that was truly most wonderful.

37	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	Never, in our day, was there so hard and terrible a combat, nor so many assembled on one field, especially of horsemen ;		
38					 and the number who fell on both sides was fearful to behold.		
39	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	The battle continued from nine in the morning till midday 		
40					but the great khan at last remained master of the field.		
41	1	PART 1	4	Description of the Battle	When Nayan and his men saw that they could hold out no longer, they betook themselves to flight ; 		
42					but it availed them nothing		
43					he was taken, and all his troops surrendered.		
44	1	PART 1	5	The Death of Nayan	When that great monarch heard that Nayan was taken, he ordered him to be put to death in the manner I am now to tell you.		
45	1	PART 1	5	The Death of Nayan	He was wrapped in a carpet, and violently tossed to and fro till he died.

49	1	PART 1	6	Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens	"When the monarch had achieved this triumph, the Saracens, Pagans, Jews, and other generations of men who believe not in God, expressed wonder at the cross which the vanquished leader had carried on his standard, and said in derision of the Christians,-""see how the cross of your God has aided Nayan and his people."""		Saracens ,Nayan
50	1	PART 1	6	Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens	"They made such a noise on this subject, that it came to the ears of the prince, who was much displeased, and sending for the Christians, said to them,-""if your God did not assist Nayan, he acted with great justice, because he is a good and righteous God.

51	1	PART 1	6	Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens	"Then the Christians replied,-""O, great sire! thou hast spoken the truth, for the cross will aid nothing unjust, and he met only what he well deserved."""

53	1	PART 1	6	Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens	When the other king, named Kaidu, heard how his ally had been worsted, he was struck with fear, and did not attempt to lead his army against the monarch.		
54					Now you have seen how that prince went to battle,and for what cause, while on all other occasions he sent his son and his barons;		
55					but this war was of such magnitude that it seemed to deserve his own immediate presence. 		
56	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	The grand khan, having obtained this splendid victory, returned with great pomp and triumph to his capital of Kambalu.	Kambalu

60	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	Such was the custom upon each of the two great festivals of Easter and Christmas		Easter
61					and he followed the same course as that pursued by the Saracens, Jews, and idolaters.		Saracens
62	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	"Being asked the reason of this conduct, he replied,-""there are four great prophets revered and worshipped by different classes of mankind. The Christians hold Christ as their divinity ; the Saracens, Mohammed ; the Jews, Moses; and the idolaters, Sogomombar Khan, their most distinguished idol. I honour and respect all the four, and seek aid from them, as any one of them may really be supreme in heaven."""		Saracens ,Moses
63	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	Yet, from the behaviour of his majesty towards the Christians, he evidently believed their faith the best and truest ; 		
64					observing, that it enjoined nothing on its professors that was not full of virtue and holiness.		
65	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	He would not indeed allow the cross to be borne before them in processions, because, as he said, on it so exalted a person had been nailed and put to death.		
66	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	Some may ask, why if thus partial to the true faith, he did not openly embrace it?		
67	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	He stated his reason to Nicolo and Maffio Polo, when, on his sending them ambassadors to the Pope, they ventured to address to him a few words on the subject.		Nicolo
68	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	""" Why ""said he, ""should I become a Christian?"""		
69	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	You must yourselves see that the professors of that faith now in this country are ignorant and weak, unable to do any thing extraordinary, while the idolaters have power to do whatever they please.		
70	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	While I am seated at table, the cups, filled with wine or other beverage, come to me from the middle of the hall spontaneously, without being touched by any human hand.		
71	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	They are able to control bad weather, and force it to retire to any quarter of the heavens; 		
72					they can perform other wonderful things of the same nature.		
73	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	You have witnessed their idols exercising the faculty of speech, and predicting whatever events are inquired into.		
74	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	Should I become a convert and profess Christianity, the nobles of my court, and others disinclined to the faith, will ask what adequate motives have induced me to be baptized.		Christianity
75	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	What wonders, what miracles, they will say, have its ministers performed?

77	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	To this I shall be unable to make any answer, and be considered as labouring under a grievous mistake, while the heathen teachers, by the profound art which they display, may easily accomplish my death.		
78	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	Return, however, to your pontiff, and present to him my request, that he would send a hundred persons learned in your law, who, when confronted with the others, will be able to control them, and while proving themselves endowed with similar skill, shall render their antagonists unable in their presence to carry on these practices.		
79	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	On witnessing this, I will interdict the exercise of their religion, and suffer myself to be baptized.		
80	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	This example will be followed by all my nobility, and by my subjects in general ;		
81					 so that the Christians in these regions will become more numerous than those inhabiting your own country.		
82	1	PART 1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	From this language it evidently appears that had the pope sent out persons duly qualified to preach the gospel, the great khan would have embraced that faith, for which he certainly entertained a strong predilection.
