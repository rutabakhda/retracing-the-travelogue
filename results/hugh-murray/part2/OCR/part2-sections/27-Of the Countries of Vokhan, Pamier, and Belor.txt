When a man departs from Badascian, he goes twelve days between north-east and east, along a river which belongs to a brother of the lord of that land. There are many castles, and a good number of inhabitants, who are valiant and adore Mohammed. He then comes to a province named Vokhan, not very large, being only three days’ journey in every direction. The people are of the same description, and subject to the ruler of Badascian.Wild beasts and birds of every kind for hunting are most abundant. Having left this place, and travelled three days, always over mountains, he ascends to a district which is said to be the highest in the world. Here he finds a plain between two vast hills, through which flows a very fine river, issuing from a large lake ; and it is the best pasturage in the world, for a lean animal becomes fat here in ten days.All kinds of wild animals abound ; in particular, a species of sheep with horns of three, four, and even six palms long. These are formed by the shepherds into large spoons, out of which they eat ; and are even employed in enclosing the places where they keep their cattle. The hornsare heaped up in large quantities along the road, for the purpose of guiding travellers during winter, when it is covered with snow.t While a man passes for twelve days along this high plain, which is called Pamier,§ he sees neither habitation nor verdure, but must carry all his provisions along with him. No birds can live in this cold region; and I can even state that the fire does not burn so clear nor with the same colour as in other places, nor does it cook victuals so well.Leaving this place, he has to go on forty days between north and north-east, and passes many rivers and deserts ; and in all this journey finds neither verdure nor habitation, but must carry all his provisions along with him. This country is called Belor.t The people live in very lofty mountains, They are idolaters, extremely savage, violent, and cruel, subsist by hunting, and dress themselves in the skins of beasts.
