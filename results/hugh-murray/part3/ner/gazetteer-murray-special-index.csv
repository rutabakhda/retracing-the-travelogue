545	3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	546	I can tell you, moreover, that these Christians are the  most skilful enchanters in the world.					
546	3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	547	The archbishop, indeed, forbids and even punishes this practice, but without any avail ;					
547	3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	548	for their ancestors, they say, followed it before them, and they will continue.

565	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	566	Mariners, however, cannot reach the other islands lying south of this and of Zanghibar, owing to the violence of the current running in this direction.			Zanghibar	Zanghibar	
566	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	567	It is such, that while vessels can come hither from Malabar in twenty days, they spend three months in returning.			Malabar	Malabar	
567	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	568	Now I must mention, that in these southern isles, the birds called griffon are reported to exist, and to appear at certain seasons ; 					
568	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	569	yet they are not formed as we describe and paint them, half-bird, half-lion, but exactly like the eagle, only immeasurably larger.					
569	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	570	They are represented so huge and powerful, as to take up the elephant and carry him high into the air, then let him drop, whereby he is at once killed, and they feed upon his carcass.					
570	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	571	It is asserted that their wings are twelve paces long, and when spread out, extend thirty paces across ;

572	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	573	I must add, that the khan sent messengers to obtain information about the country, and also the release of one of his subjects who had been made prisoner.		Khan			Khan
573	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	574	They and the captive related to him many great wonders of these strange isles, and brought teeth of a wild boar, inconeivably large: I assure you, he found them to weigh fourteen pounds.					
574	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	575	You may thus judge as to the size of the boar ; 					
575	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	576	and indeed some are equal to a buffalo.					
576	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	577	There are also giraffes and wild asses, and other beasts and birds wonderfully different from ours.					
577	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	578	To return to the griffon; the people of the island do not know it by that name, but call it always ruc; 					
578	3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	579	but we, from their extraordinary size, certainly conclude them to be griffons.

584	3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	585	They are perfectly black, and go naked, with the exception of a cloth round the waist.					
585	3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	586	Their mouth is so wide, their nose so turned up, their lips and eyes so big, that they are horrible to behold,and any one meeting them in another country would believe them devils.

601	3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	602	When leading the elephant to the combat, they give him to drink of their wine or liquor, which renders him more fierce and effective.

923	3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	924	This rugged tract extends thirteen days' journey, and at the end of each is a post-house to accom modate the messengers, with about forty dogs, almost as large as asses, to convey them from one post to the other.					
924	3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	925	As wheeled carriages cannot travel here, they employ sledges, so formed as to move over the surface without sinking ; such, indeed, as are used in this country to convey hay and straw when there is great rain and mud.

977	3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	978	Alau, a great and powerful prince, proposes wrongfully to fight against us; 		Alau			Alau
978	3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	979	but having the right on our side, we may confidently expect to conquer, especially since our army is more numerous.

980	3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	981	He was then silent ; 					
981	3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	982	and we must now return to his antagonist, who, when he heard of his adversary's arrival with so great an army, assembled his principal men and said :- Noble brethren and friends, you have throughout all my life supported and aided me, enabling me to conquer in many battles; 					
982	3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	983	nor indeed ever fighting one in which we were not victorious.

1057	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1058	Never almost was there a battle in which such numbers fell ; 					
1058	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1059	but the greater loss was on the side of Toctai, for his adversary had better men-at-arms.		Toctai			
1059	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1060	The two sons of Totamangu displayed great prowess, striving to the utmost to avenge the death of their father; 		Totamangu			
1060	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1061	but it was in vain.					
1061	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1062	The battle, in short, was most bloody and dreadful; 					
1062	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1063	many who in the morning were alive and vigorous, during the day fell slain, and many happy wives were made widows.					
1063	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1064	Toctai strove with all his might to support his people and his honour, and displayed indeed a prowess worthy to be praised by the whole world.		Toctai			
1064	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1065	He rushed amid the enemy like one that cared nothing for life or death, striking to right and left, rescuing his people when seized or taken.					
1065	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1066	He did much injury that day both to enemies and friends; 					
1066	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1067	of the one he killed a vast number, and the other, from his example, derived boldness to push against their foe, and thus met instant death.					
1067	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1068	Nogai, on his side, equally acted the hero; 		Nogai			
1068	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1069	he rushed among the enemy as the lion does among other wild beasts, casting down and killing all whom he encountered.					
1069	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1070	He threw himself among the thickest of the foe, and all fled before him like weak and timid animals.					
1070	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1071	His troops emulated his valour ; but why make a long story !					
1071	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1072	The people of Toctai did every thing possible to support their honour, though in vain, for they had too good and stout men to deal with.		Toctai			
1072	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1073	They had suffered so much as to make it evident that if they remained they would all perish.					
1073	3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	1074	They therefore took to flight as quickly as they could, the victor with his troops pursuing and killing them in great numbers.

1076	3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	1077	You have now been informed of all the actions of the Tartars and Saracens, of their customs, and of other countries throughout the world, so far as they could be searched out and discovered.					
1077	3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	1078	We have only declined saying any thing of the Black Sea and the surrounding provinces, although we fully explored them, because it would seemingly have been useless, and a repetition of what others relate every day.

1081	3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	1082	But I believe it was the pleasure of God, that they might make known the great things that are in the world, and, as formerly declared in the preface, there never was a man, either Christian or Saracen, or Tartar or Pagan, who explored so much of the world as did Marco, the son of Nicolo Polo, that noble and great citizen of Venice.
