On leaving that port, and sailing west and somewhat south-west 1500 miles, you reach a country named Cianba,which is very rich and extensive. The people are idolaters, have a language of their own, and 9 king, who pays tribute to the great khan, but only in fine elephants peculiar to the country. That monarch, seeking to subdue him, sent, in 1278, one of his barons with many men, horse and foot, who began to lay waste the country. The sovereign, who was very aged and much afraid of such powerful warriors, did not venture to engage them on the open plain, remaining secure in strong cities and fortresses ; but all the lands and houses were wasted and destroyed. Grieved at the desolation of the territory, he sent messengers, who said to the great khan, “ Sir, the King of Cianba salutes you as his liege lord, and states himself to be a man of great age, who has long preserved his kingdom in peace. He offers to be your vassal, and pay a liberal tribute in elephants, and beseeches that your baron and army will cease to ravage his kingdom.” The khan, having heard this message, took pity upon him, and ordered his general to withdraw, and conquer another country ; and he has ever since received this tribute of the largest and most beautiful elephants.t In this kingdom, no handsome girl can be married till the king sees her, when, if pleased, he takes her to wife ; otherwise, he gives her money, with which she can be married to a nobleman. In 1285, when I, Marco Polo, was there, the king had 326 sons and daughters, of whom 150 were men that could carry arms. Besides elephants, the country abounds in lignum aloes, and the wood called ebony,which is very black, used in making chess-boards and writingdesks. I now proceed to a great island named Java.
