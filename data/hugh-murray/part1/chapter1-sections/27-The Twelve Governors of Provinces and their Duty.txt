He has appointed twelve very great barons, who hold command over all things in the thirty-four provinces. They reside in a palace within the city of Kambalu, large and beautiful, containing many halls and apartments ; and for every province there is an agent and a number of writers or notaries, having each a house to himself. They manage all the provincial affairs according to the will and pleasure of the twelve barons. The latter have power to appoint the lords of the provinces above mentioned ; and having chosen the one whom they judge best qualified, they name him to the great khan, who confirms him, and bestows a golden tablet corresponding to his command. These twelve barons are called in the Tartar language scieng, that is, the greater officers of state. They order the army to go where and in what numbers they please, but all according to the commands of the great sire ; and they do every other thing necessary for the provinces. The palace in which they dwell is called scien, and is the largest in all the court; they have the power of doing much good to any one whom they favour.
