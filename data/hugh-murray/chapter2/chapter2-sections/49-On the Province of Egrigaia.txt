When a man departs from Erginul, and goes eight days castward, he finds a province of Tangut called Egrigaia, where there are cities and castles, and the chief one is named Calacian.The people are idolaters ; yet there are three towns held by Nestorian Christians. They are subject to the great Tartar; and in this city is made cloth of camels’ hair, the most beautiful and valuable in the world. There is akind of wool whence they manufacture very fine white camlets in great quantities. These the merchants convey by many routes to Cathay and other parts throughout the world. Now let us go to Tenduc, in the territory of Prester John.
