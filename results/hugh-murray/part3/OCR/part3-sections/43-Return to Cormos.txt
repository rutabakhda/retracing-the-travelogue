After departing from Calatu, and sailing three hundred miles between north-west and north, you find the city of Cormos ;but if you take a direction from the former place between north-west and north, and sail five hundred miles, you come to Quis. However, we shall pass over this last place, and speak of Cormos, a large and noble capital, subject to a melik, who commands many townsand castles. The people are Saracens, and adore Mohammed. The heat is very great, on which account every house is provided with ventilators placed on the side whence the wind blows, which being thus admitted, renders the mansion tolerably cool. We gave an account of this place formerly, as well as of Quis and Creman, but have since made a circuit which brought us back to it. However, we will say no more, but proceed now to the description of Great Turkey.
