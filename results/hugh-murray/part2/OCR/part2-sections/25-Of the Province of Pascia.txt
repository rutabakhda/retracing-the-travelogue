You are to know that ten days south from Badascian is a province called Pascia.The people have a peculiar language ; they are worshippers of idols, and much skilled in enchantments and diabolical arts. The men wear ear-rings and buckles of gold and silver, with pearls and precious stones. They are a very artful and malicious people. The province is extremely hot, and the people live upon flesh and rice. Now let us leave it, and tell of another, which is distant from this seven days towards the south-east.
