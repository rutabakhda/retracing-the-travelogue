India and the Ships navigating thither. Having described so many inland provinces, I will now enter upon India, with the wonderful objects in that region. The ships in which the merchants navigate thither are made of fir, with only one deck, but many of them are divided beneath into sixty compartments, in each of which a person can be conveniently accommodated. They have one rudder and four masts ; while some have two additional, which can be put up and taken down at pleasure. Many of the largest have besides as many as thirteen divisions in the hold, formed of thick planks mortised into each other. The object is to guard against accidents which may cause the vessel to spring a leak, such as striking on a rock or being attacked by a whale, This last circumstance is not unusual ; for dur-  ing the night the motion of the ship through the waves  raises a foam that invites the hungry animal, which,  hoping to find food, rushes violently against the hull,  and often forces in part of the bottom. The water,  entering by the leak, runs on to the well, which is al-  ways kept clear ; and the crew, on perceiving the occur-  rence, remove the goods from the inundated division, and  the boards are so tight that it cannot pass to any other.  They then repair the injury and replace the articles. The  plaiJ^ are double, fastened with iron nails, and plastered  without and within, but not secured by pitch, of which  the people are destitute. They therefore take lime, beat  it into fine powder, and mix it with an oil from trees, so  that it becomes equal to glue. These vessels carry two  hundred mariners, and five or six thousand loads of  pepper ; they are moved by oars, on each of which four  hands are employed. Every one of them has two barks,  large enough to carry a thousand loads, and forty seamen  well armed, who often assist in dragging the large ships.   Ten small boats are also kept for fishing and various other services ; two being attached to each bark. ‘When the ships have sailed a year, and stand in need of repair, a fresh plank is fastened above the two others, then nailed and cemented, till they sometimes acquire a depth of six planks. Having thus described the merchant-vessels that go to India, I will tell you of the country itself ; but first I must mention the many isles in this sea lying to the eastward ; and first, of one named Zipangu.
