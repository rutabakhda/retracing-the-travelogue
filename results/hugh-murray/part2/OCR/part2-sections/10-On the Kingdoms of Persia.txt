Know, then, that in Persia there are eight kingdoms, because it is a very great country, and I will tell you their names. The first is called Casum ;the second, to the south, Cardistan ; the third Lor ; the fourth Cielstan ;the fifth Istanit ;he sixth Cerazi ;the seventh Soucara ;the eighth Tonocain,which is on the remotest frontier. In this last are many fine horses of high value, which are taken in large numbers to be sold in India; and the greater part of them are worth two hundred livres tournoiseach. They have also the finest asses in the world, one of which is worth full thirty mares of silver.The men of that country lead these horses to two cities on the banks of the sea of India, called Chisi and Curmosa, and find there merchants, who buy them and carry them into their distant country. In these kingdoms there are many cruel men, who are constantly killing one another, and but for the fear of the Eastern Tartars, who now rule in this land, they would ruin the merchants. As it is, unless the latter are well provided with arms and bows, they often kill or hurt them severely.These men all hold the law of Mohammed. In the city are industrious merchants ; they make robes of silk and gold of various fashions, and raise also plenty of cotton. The country abounds in wheat, barley, millet, as well asin vines and other fruits.Some may imagine that the Saracens do not drink wine, as being forbidden by their law ; but they quiet their consciences by thinking that if boiled over the fire, which renders it milder and sweet, it may be drunk without breaking the commandment. Changing its taste, they change its name, and no longer call it wine, though it really is so.Let us now leave them, and tell you of Yasdi.
