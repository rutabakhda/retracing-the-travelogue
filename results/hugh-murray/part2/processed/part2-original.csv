2	part2	29	Of the City of Samarcan	216	Now it came to pass that Ciagatai died, whereupon the Mohammedans, having been much enraged at this stone being taken for the use of the church, consulted with each other how to recover it by force.
2	part2	29	Of the City of Samarcan	217	This they could now easily do, being ten to one of their adversaries, Several of their elders went and told the Christians that they wished to receive back the slab, which had been formerly theirs.
2	part2	29	Of the City of Samarcan	218	The latter answered, that they would willingly restore it, but for the injury it would do to their building, and offered to pay a fair price for it.

2	part2	3	On Armenia the Greater	229	I assure you the province is very large, and during the summer all the Tartars of the Levant reside here with their flocks and herds, on account of its rich pastures ; but in winter they cannot remain because of the severe cold and snow, amid which the animals could not live.
2	part2	3	On Armenia the Greater	230	Now, in this Armenia is the ark of Noah on a great mountain.
2	part2	3	On Armenia the Greater	231	The circuit of its base cannot be traversed in less than two days ; and the ascent is rendered impracticable by the snow on its summit, which never dissolves, but is increased by each successive fall.
2	part2	3	On Armenia the Greater	232	On the lower declivities, the melted snows cause an abundant vegetation, and afford rich pastures for the cattle which in summer resort thither from all the surrounding -countries.

2	part2	3	On Armenia the Greater	235	It is not good for eating, but very fit for fuel, for anointing the camels in maladies of the skin, and for other purposes ; for which reason people come from a great distance for it, and nothing else is burned in all this country.

2	part2	32	Of the Province of Pein	256	Now let us tell of a province named Ciarcian.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	257	Ciarcian is a province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east, with a capital city of the same name.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	258	The people adore Mohammed, and have a good number of towns and castles, There is a river bringing jasper and calcedony, which, being of excellent quality, they take to sell in Cathay, and thus make great profit.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	259	This province is sandy, as well as the whole road from Cotan hither ; and much of the water is bad and bitter, but in various places it is good.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	260	When an enemy passes through the country, they flee with their wives, children, and cattle, two or three days’ journey through the sand to places abounding in fine water and pasturage ; and no one can tell where they have gone, because the wind blowing the sand obliterates all traces of their march, and they thus escape the invader.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	261	But when a friendly army passes through, they send away only the beasts, because the troops would take and eat them, without any payment.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	262	After departing from Ciarcian, you go five days through the waste, finding the water bad and bitter, but occasionally sweet and good.
2	part2	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	263	At the end of these five days you come to a city which lies at the commencement of the great desert, wherein provisions are laid in for its passage, and therefore I must tell you about it.

2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	267	t It consists altogether of mountains and valleys of sand, and nothing is got to eat; but after travelling a day and a night, you find sweet water sufficient for from fifty to a hundred men, with their animals.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	268	A larger body could not be supplied.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	269	Thus, water is seen daily, or altogether in about twenty-eight places, and except in three or four it is good.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	270	Beasts or birds there are none, because they could not find food; but there is agreat wonder which I must now tell you.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	271	When a party rides by night through this desert, and any one lags behind, or straggles from his companions through sleep or any other cause, when he seeks to return to them, he hears spirits speak to him in such a manner that they seem to be his comrades, and they frequently call him by name, and thus lead him out of his way so that he never regains it, and many persons are thus lost and perish.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	272	I must tell you, too, that even by day you hear these voices of spirits, and even tambours, and many other instruments sounding.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	273	They find it necessary, also, before going to rest at night, to fix an advanced signal, pointing out the course to be afterwards held ; likewise to attach a bell to each of the animals, that they may be more easily kept from straggling.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	274	In this manner, amid much danger and fear, this desert is passed.
2	part2	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	275	Now we must tell you of the countries that lie on the other side.

2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	279	Every man who has children rears a sheep, and at a particular festival at the end of the year, leads them along with that animal into the presence of the god, to whom they all perform reverence.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	280	They cook the sheep and offer it very humbly before the idol, leaving it while they make their prayers for the safety of their children.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	281	They then take the meat and carry it to the house, or wherever they please, send for their relations, and eat it with great joy and respect.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	282	They afterwards collect the bones, and preserve them with much diligence.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	283	You must know likewise, that when any one of them dies, his body is burned, and after he is carried to the place for this last ceremony, they erect in the middle of the path a house of cane, covered with cloths of silk and gold.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	284	When the dead man is laid before this ornamented house, they place before him wine and victuals, believing that he will be similarly honoured in the other world.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	285	At the place of burning, too, they cut in paper, men, horses, camels, and coins of the size of bezarits, convinced that the deceased will possess all these things in the future state.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	286	On this occasion, all the instruments in the land are sounded before the corpse.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	287	I must tell you, too, that after death the relations send for the astrologer, who is informed of the day, month, and year of his nativity, and then divines, by his diabolical art, the day on which the burning ought to take place.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	288	If it should be a week, a month, or six months, they keep it all that time, and never burn it till the appointed day.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	289	During this interval, they deposit it in a large box covered with cloth, and so preserved with crocus and other spices that no stench arises.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	290	Throughout this period, they place daily before the box meat and drink, and leave it there for some time, till they think he has eaten it.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	291	These sorcerers, too, often tell the relations that the dead body must not be carried out by the main door, but by a private one, or even through a breach made in the wall.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	292	All the idolaters in the world proceed in this manner.
2	part2	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	293	Now I must go to another city which lies to the south, near the extremity of this desert.

2	part2	36	Of the City of Kamul	301	When they received this injunction, they were greatly grieved, held a council, and did what I will now tell you.
2	part2	36	Of the City of Kamul	302	They made up a large present, and sent it to Mangou, praying that he would allow them to treat their wives according to the custom handed down to them by their ancestors, who, for this kindness to strangers, had gained the favour of their idols, and their corn and other crops had greatly multiplied.
2	part2	36	Of the City of Kamul	303	When he heard this message, he said, “Since you are so bent on your own shame, let it be so”.
2	part2	36	Of the City of Kamul	304	He allowed them, therefore, to do as they pleased, and hence they have always maintained this custom.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	305	Ginghintalas is a province which is near the desert, between north and south, sixteen days’ journey in extent, and subject to the great khan.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	306	It contains cities, castles, and three descriptions of men, idolaters, adorers .
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	307	of Mohammed, and Nestorian Christians.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	308	On the borders of it, towards the north, is a mountain containing a very abundant vein of copper and antimony.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	309	There is also one from which is made the salamander; but do not suppose this is the animal so called, for no creature can live in fire, because it is compounded of the four elements.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	310	It is only through ignorance that the salamander is called an animal ; and a Turk, named Zurficar, who was very learned, and governor of this province for three years under the great khan, being much employed in working the mines, gave me an account of it.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	311	When this ore is taken from the mountain, and is broken, it strings together, and forms a thread like wool.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	312	Being then dried, pounded in a large mortar, and washed, there remains that thread of which I have spoken.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	313	Being then woven like wool, it forms cloth, which is dingy in colour at first, but when placed and left some time in the fire, it becomes white as snow, without dirt or stain.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	314	This is the truth of the salamander, and every thing else said about itis mere fable.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	315	I can tell you, too, that at Rome there is a cloth which the great khan sent to the pope as a costly present, and the sudarium of our Lord was placed within it.
2	part2	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	316	Now let us tell you of other provinces to the south-east and east.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	317	When you have departed from the province now described, you go ten days in the same direction.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	318	In all that way there are few habitations, nor does any thing occur worth mentioning.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	319	You then finda district called Succiur,with a capital of the same name.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	320	The people are Christians, and idolaters, and under the great khan.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	321	All the three provinces last described belong to the general one named Tangut.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	322	Through all its mountains, rhubarb is found in great abundance, and the merchants purchase and carry it over the whole world.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	323	t They cannot, however, take this road through the mountains with any animals but those accustomed to the country, because a poisonous plant grows there, which, when eaten, causes the hoofs to drop off ; but the native cattle, having learned its dangerous quality, carefully avoid it.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	324	t They live by the fruits of the earth, but attend little to merchandise.
2	part2	38	Of the Province of Succiur	325	Now I must tell you of another city.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	326	Canpicion is a great and noble town, chief and capital of the whole province of Tangut.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	327	The people are idolaters, and there are some who adore Mohammed, and also Christians who have three large and beautiful churches.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	328	The first have monasteries and abbeys according to their custom, with a very great number of idols, some of which, I assure you, are ten paces high, severally formed of wood, of earth, and of stone, all beautifully covered with gold and ivory.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	329	Their priests live more respectably than others, and guard themselves against luxury, though they do not hold it for a very great sin.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	330	They observe the lunar months like ours, and in one of them do not kill any beast or bird.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	331	For five days they eat no food that has had life, and live more strictly than usual.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	332	They take sometimes thirty wives, or as many as they have wealth to maintain, and give them a dowry in beasts, slaves, and money ; but the first wife ranks always as the principal.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	333	If any of them do not please him, she may be divorced.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	334	They marry their cousins and even the wives of their father, and do not regard as sins many things which we account great ones ; for they live like beasts : therefore let us leave them and go to the north.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	335	But I must tell you that Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco, remained in that city a year, on particular business which I need not enter into.
2	part2	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	336	We shall now go sixty days northwards.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	337	In Georgia§ is a king always called David Melik, which means David the King ; he is subject to the Tartars ; and anciently all the monarchs of this province were born with the mark of an eagle on their left shoulder.

2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	340	This is the province which Alexander could not pass through on account of the narrowness of the path ; because on one side is the sea, and on the other very high mountains, over which it is impossible to ride ; and, as this strait continues above four leagues, a few men might hold out against the whole world.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	341	This was the reason why he could not pass; but he built a very strong tower, that no one might come upon him from the other side, and it is called the Iron Gate.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	342	This is the place mentioned in the book of Alexander, where he enclosed the Tartars within their mountains ; though the Tartars did not exist at that time, but a certain people called Comani, and other races besides.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	343	.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	344	There are many cities and castles, with silk in abundance, with which, added to gold, they make cloths the most beautiful that ever man saw.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	345	Here are the finest cagles in the world ; also victuals of every kind in abundance.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	346	The province is full of great mountains, and of narrow passes, so that I can tell you the Tartars could never obtain the entire sovereignty of it.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	347	There isa monastery called St Leonard, containing a great wonder, which I will now relate.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	348	A large lake of water issues from a neighbouring mountain, in which, during the whole year, there is not found a fish great or small, except from the day before Lent down to the evening of Easter Sunday ; and during the whole of that time fishes are taken in great abundance, but none at any other.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	349	And know that this sea of which I have spoken is seven hundred miles in circuit, and receives the Euphrates, one of the delights of paradise, and many other great rivers.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	350	It is all surrounded by mountain and land; and lately the merchants of Genoa, who have built shipa, navigate it, bringing silk, which is called gelle.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	351	* Into this sea the great rivers Herdil,t Geihon, Kur, and Aras enter.

2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	353	The inhabitants are Armenian and Georgian Christians, with some few Mohammedans and Jews.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	354	There are manufactures of silk and other articles.
2	part2	4	On Georgia and its Productions	355	Now, having told you of the boundaries of Armenia to the north, I will describe those to the south and east.
2	part2	40	Of the Province of Ezina	356	After riding twelve days, you come to a city named Ezina,which is at the northern extremity of the desert of sand, and still in Tangut.
2	part2	40	Of the Province of Ezina	357	The people, who are idolaters, breed camels and other beasts, and have falcons of different species and of good quality.

2	part2	40	Of the Province of Ezina	359	In this city, a man lays in provisions for forty days, during which time, travelling from Ezina northwards, there is neither habitation nor inns.
2	part2	40	Of the Province of Ezina	360	But the people, except during summer, remain in the valleys; and in the mountains they find a number of wild beasts, especially asses: there are also pine-forests.
2	part2	40	Of the Province of Ezina	361	At the end of these forty days they reach a northern province, and you shall hear what it is.
2	part2	41	Of the City of Karakorum	362	Karakorum isa city three miles in circuit,which was the first that the Tartars took when they issued from their country, and I am to tell you of their actions and manners, how they gained command, and spread themselves over the world.
2	part2	41	Of the City of Karakorum	363	You must know that they dwelt in the north, about Ciorcia, in which region are great plains, and no abode in cities or castles, but good pasturage, large rivers, and abundance of water.
2	part2	41	Of the City of Karakorum	364	They had no lords, yet paid tribute to the great sire, named in their language Unchan, whom we call Prester John, and who is spoken of over all the world.
2	part2	41	Of the City of Karakorum	365	They paid to him one beast out of every ten; but they multiplied so greatly, that he became afraid of them, and resolved to separate them into different countries; for which purpose he sent his barons among them.
2	part2	41	Of the City of Karakorum	366	The Tartars on hearing this were much grieved, and, holding a council, determined to flee through desert countries to the north, where he could not reach nor injure them.
2	part2	41	Of the City of Karakorum	367	They then ceased to obey or pay tribute to him,and remained thus for a long time.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	368	Now it happened that, about 1187, the Tartars appointedaking, who was named in their language Gengis Khan.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	369	He was a man of great worth, sense, and prowess; and let me tell you, when he was elected, all the Tartars in the world that were scattered through those strange countries came and owned him as their lord.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	370	He maintained his power with great vigour, and the multitudes who ranged under his standard were almost innumerable.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	371	When he saw so numerous an army, he went conquering other countries, and made himself master of eight provinces ; yet he neither injured nor robbed the people of any thing, but placing them under leaders in whom he could confide, led them on to other triumphs.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	372	Thus he overthrew, as you have.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	373	heard, a multitude of nations ; and seeing his good command and mildness, they cheerfully followed him, upon which he formed the design of subduing a great part of the world.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	374	In the year 1200, he sent a message to Prester John, asking his daughter to wife.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	375	"Hereupon that monarch was very indignant, and said,—""What impudence is this in Gengis Khan!"
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	376	Knows he not that he is my man and my vassal?
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	377	Return, and tell him that I would burn my daughter sooner than give her to him, and that he deserves to be put to death as a traitor and disloyal to hislord”.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	378	He then desired the messengers to depart forthwith, and never return.
2	part2	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	379	They presently went away, and coming to their master, told him in order all that the other had said.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	380	When Gengis Khan heard this boastful speech, his heart swelled, so that it almost burst within him ; for you must know he was a man of very great pride.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	381	He then said to his minister, and to all about him, that he would not continue to hold the sovereignty, unless Prester John were made to pay more dearly for this villany than ever man did, and he must soon be made to see whether he was his vassal.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	382	Then he summoned round him the greatest army that ever was seen or heard of, and sent notice to Unchan that he must defend himself, as he was coming against him.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	383	When that prince knew certainly the approach of Gengis with so great a force, he made light of it, saying, they were not men-at-arms ; yet.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	384	resolved that should he approach, he would do all in his power to take and put him todeath.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	385	He then ordered all his people to be prepared and summoned from many and strange parts,and a greater host and of more formidable aspect was never seen.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	386	And why make a long story!
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	387	The khan, with all his people, came to a great and beautiful plain, named Tenduc, in Prester John’s country, where he pitched his camp, and rejoiced greatly to hear that his enemy was coming, because it was an excellent situation for giving battle.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	388	He sent for his astrologers, who were Christian and Saracen, and required to know which would conquer in that battle, he or his antagonist.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	389	The latter could tell nothing of the truth ; but the former showed it openly; for they brought before him a cane, cut in the middle, and placed the two parts on different sides, and wrote the name of Gengis on one, and of Unchan on the other, telling him, that when they had made their enchantment, he whose cane should come above that of the other would conquer in battle.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	390	He desired that this should be shown to him as soon as possible.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	391	Then they took up the Psaltery, read certain portions, and performed their enchantment, when presently the cane on which was the name of Gengis, without any one touching it, joined the other, and mounted above it, and this was witnessed by all present.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	392	When he saw this, he was greatly rejoiced, and seeing that the Christians were men of truth, held them always in great honour.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	393	Two days after, the armies engaged, and it was the greatest battle that ever was fought.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	394	The slaughter was terrible on both sides; but at length Gengis conquered, his enemy was slain in the engagement, and he himself became master of all his land.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	395	From that day he went on conquering many castles and provinces, and reigned six years ; but, at the end of that time, he besieged a fort, named Cangui, where he was wounded in the knee by an arrow, and died.
2	part2	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	396	This was a great misfortune, for he was a brave and wise man.
2	part2	44	On the Khans who reigned after the Death of Gengis	397	After the death of Gengis, the next khan was Cui, the third Bacui, the fourth Alton, the fifth Mangou, the sixth Kublai,who is greater and more powerful than all the rest; for the other five together had not so much power as this Kublai ; nay, let me tell you, that all the emperors in the world, and all the Christian and Saracen kings, do not equal him, as is shown fully in our book.
2	part2	44	On the Khans who reigned after the Death of Gengis	398	Now you must know that the great lords of the lineage of Gengis Khan are buried in a lofty mountain called Altai, and whenever the chief lords of the Tartars die, if it should be a hundred days’ journey distant, they must be conveyed thither to be interred.
2	part2	44	On the Khans who reigned after the Death of Gengis	399	I will tell you another striking wonder ; that when the bodies of the khans are carried to these mountains, the conductors put to the sword all the men whom they meet on the road, saying, “ Go and serve the great lord in the other world ;” and they do the same to the horses, killing also for that purpose the best he has, You must know that when Mangou died, more than 20,000 men were slain, who had been met on the road when his body was removed to be buried.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	400	Now since I have begun speaking of the Tartars, I will tell you many thingsabout them.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	401	They abide during winter in plains and warm situations, where there is abundant herbage for their cattle; and in summer they retire to cool places on mountains and high valleys, where water abounds.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	402	They have wooden houses covered with felt, of a round shape, which they convey with them wherever they go; for they have them so well bound with twigs as to be easily carried.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	403	Whenever they take down and set up a house, the gate is always placed to the south.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	404	They have waggons so well covered with black felt, that if it should rain the whole day, no water would reach any thing within ; and they are drawn by oxen and camels.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	405	On the top they place their wives and children ; and I must tell you that the ladies buy, sell, and perform all the work necessary for their husbands, who do nothing but hunt, hawk, and go to war.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	406	They live on flesh, milk, and the produce of hunting, and likewise on rats of Pharaoh, which are found here in great numbers.

2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	408	They shun the seduction of married females, as a most vile and shameful thing; and the wives are very faithful, performing extremely well the business of the household.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	409	Every man may take as many as he pleases, even to a hundred, if he can maintain them ; yet they hold the first as the principal and most respectable.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	410	They scruple not to marry their cousins, and if the father dies, the eldest son may take all his wives, except his own mother ; he marries also the widow of his deceased brother.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	411	They celebrate their marriages by great festivals.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	412	The Tartars, who believe in a deity of a sublime and heavenly nature, burn incense in censers to him, and pray that he may preserve them in health of mind and body.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	413	They have also one called Nacygai, whom they call their earthly god, who guards their children, cattle, and corn, They fashion him of felt and cloth, keep him in their house, and pay him great honour and reverence.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	414	They make for him also a wife and children of cloth, placing the first on his left hand, and the latter in front.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	415	Before eating, they take the fat meat and anoint his mouth with it; then lay bread before the door of his chamber.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	416	Having done this, they say that their god and his family have had their share, and sit down to their own meals, I told you that they drink mare’s milk, but it is in such a manner that it seems white wine, being of an agreeable taste, and called chemius.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	417	The wealthy wear rich robes of gold and silk, with varied furs of the ermine, sable, and fox.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	418	Their harness is beautiful and of great value; their arms are bows, swords, and clubs ; but the first is more used than the others, because they are excellent archers.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	419	On their back they wear armour of buffalo and other very strong hides.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	420	I will tell you the manner in which they maintain justice.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	421	If a man has stolen an article of little value, they give him seven lashes, or seventeen, or twentyseven, going on thus always to three hundred and seven, and many die under them.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	422	If he steals a horse or any thing else for which he deserves to die, he is cut through the middle with a sword; yet if he can pay nine times the value of what he has stolen, he is allowed to live.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	423	Every lord or other man, who owns oxen or any cattle, makes them be marked with his seal, and then allows them to feed on the plains or among the mountains ; and whoever finds one straying brings it to him whose mark is upon it.

2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	425	Their cattle are all remarkably large, fat, and beautiful.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	426	They have another wonderful custom which I had forgot; for when two men have one a son, the other a daughter, dead at the age of four, they marry them together, and represent the union by cards, which they set on fire, and when they see the flame and smoke ascending, they make great shouts and run backward and forward, saying that the dead are going to their children in the other world, and are to be husband and wife there.
2	part2	45	On the Religion, Customs, and Manners of the Tartars	427	They do more, for they paint on cards the similitudes of men, horses, cloths, bezants, and harness, then burn them, and say that all these things will be possessed by their children in the other world.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	428	The Tartars are good men-at-arms in battle, capable of much endurance; and they can go through more warlike toil than other men.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	429	Often, when necessary, one of them will remain a month without any food, except the milk of a mare and the flesh of animals killed by him in hunting, his horse feeding on the grass, without his needing to bring barley or straw.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	430	He is very obedient to his master, and when necessary will remain the whole night armed on horseback.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	431	They are the men in the world most capable of enduring fatigue and trouble, subsisting at the least expense, and best fitted for conquering lands and kingdoms.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	432	They arrange their armies in the following manner.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	433	When a Tartar lord goes to war, he has with him 100,000 men.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	434	He places a chief over every ten, every hundred, every thousand, every ten thousand, so that each officer, even the commander of the hundred thousand, has to deal only with ten persons; for he gives his orders to the chiefs of ten thousand, they to those of one thousand, they to those of a hundred ; and thus every man answers to his captain.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	435	The hundred thousand is called a tut, and ten thousand a toman.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	436	When the armies are marching through plains and mountains, they send 200 men two days in advance, also behind and on each side, so that they cannot he attacked by surprise.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	437	And when they are marching a long way they carry no baggage, but merely two large leathern bags, in which they put their milk, and a little earthen pot for cooking their victuals.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	438	They take a small tent, under which they remain during rain.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	439	And I tell you also, that when necessary they ride full ten days without food, and without lighting a fire; but piercing a vein of their horse, they drink his blood.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	440	They have likewise their milk dried into a species of paste, which, when about to use, they stir till it becomes liquid and can be drunk.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	441	When they go to battle with their enemies, they conquer in this manner: they apparently betake themselves to a shameful flight, for they have so trained their horses that they turn round and round like dogs.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	442	And when they are fleeing and hotly pursued, they fight as well as when they face the enemy ; for in their swiftest flight they wheel about and discharge their arrows, which kill both men and horses of the opposite army, who, when they think their adversaries discomfited and vanquished, fall themselves one after the other.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	443	When the Tartars have thus made a great slaughter, they turn and rush on so violently, that they soon gain a complete triumph.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	444	All that I have told you here applies to the genuine Tartars ; but they are now much altered ; those who live in Cathay have adopted the manners and customs of the idolaters ; those in the Levant imitate the Saracens.
2	part2	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	445	I have said nothing here of the mighty acts of the great khan, the sire of all the Tartars, nor of his splendid imperial court ; for these wonderful things are described elsewhere in this book.

2	part2	6	On Baldach	518	In the year of our Lord, 1255,the great sire of the Tartars, who is named Alau,brother to the great sire that now reigns, assembled a very large army, and marched upon Baldach and took it by force, which was a glorious exploit ; for it contained more than 100,000 horsemen besides foot soldiers ;and when it was taken, he found the caliph in possession of a tower full of gold, silver, and other treasure, such as never was seen at once in one place.
2	part2	6	On Baldach	519	When he discovered it he sent for the monarch and said : “Caliph, why have you amassed such a treasure, and what do you mean todo with it?
2	part2	6	On Baldach	520	Did you not know that I was your enemy, and coming to attack you with this mighty host!
2	part2	6	On Baldach	521	Knowing this, why did you not take your treasure, and give it to knights and soldiers to defend you and your city?
2	part2	6	On Baldach	522	” The caliph replied nothing, because he knew not what to say.
2	part2	6	On Baldach	523	Then, said Alau: “Caliph, since I see you love so much your treasure, I will give it you to eat”.
2	part2	6	On Baldach	524	He then commanded that he should be shut up in the tower with the treasure, and that nothing should be given to him to eat or drink.
2	part2	6	On Baldach	525	Then he said to him: “ Caliph, eat your treasure as heartily as you please, for you will never eat any thing else”.

2	part2	7	On Toris or Tauris	540	If they profess this belief, they are assured of salvation ; and through this easy absolution, which leaves scope for the perpetration of every crime, they have succeeded in converting many of the Tartars, who feel thus at liberty to indulge their worst propensities,  Near Toris is a monastery named after St Barsamo, and famous for sanctity.
2	part2	7	On Toris or Tauris	541	It contains an abbot and many monks, who dress like the Carmelites.

2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	543	Now I am to tell you of a great miracle which happened between Baldach and Mosul in the year 1225.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	544	There was a caliph in the former who held the Christians in great hatred, as it is natural for all the Saracens in the world to do, He thought day and night how he might compel all those in his country to become converts, or else kill them.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	545	Many others concurred in that wicked purpose, and they agreed upon this plan : They found in the gospel a text saying that if a Christian had as much faith as a grain of mustard-seed and made his prayer to God, he would be able to join two mountains together.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	546	On finding this text, they felt great joy, thinking they had thus either a means of converting them, or a pretext for killing them outright.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	547	He therefore sent for all the Jacobite and Nestorian believers in his country, who were very numerous; and when they came before him, he showed them this gospel, made them read it, and asked if it were true.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	548	They replied that it was so.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	549	Then, continued the caliph, since so many Christians are here, there surely must be among you this small measure of faith ; therefore, said he, pointing to a large hill in view, you must remove that mountain, or I will put you allto death, because otherwise you must be wholly destitute of faith, and on that account deserve to die.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	550	If, however, you will turn to our good law of Mohammed, you shall be forgiven; and, in the mean time, I allow you tefi days to do what is required.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	551	He then dismissed them.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	552	On hearing what the caliph had said, they were in great fear, and knew not what to resolve.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	553	Then they all assembled, small and great, men and women, the bishop, archbishop, and priests of whom there were a considerable number, and they remained eight days and eight nights in prayer, that God, in his mercy, and for the diffusion of his faith, would come to their aid, and enable them to escape this cruel death with which they were threatened.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	554	But what have I now to tell you!
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	555	While they were thus deeply engaged in prayer, an angel, by the message of God, appeared to a bishop who was a man of very holy life.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	556	He said, “Oh, bishop!
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	557	do you now go to acertain shoemaker with one eye, and tell him that at his prayer the mountain will be moved”.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	558	Now this shoemaker was a very honest and chaste man ; he fasted and went regularly to mass, and ‘gave every day bread to the poor.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	559	I will tell you a thing that he did, to prove his good faith and life.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	560	It happened one day that a very beautiful woman came to his shop to purchase a pair of shoes, and in order to make them fit, he was obliged to look at her foot and ankle, and they were so finely shaped that he felt his eye take an undue pleasure in viewing them.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	561	As soon as she was gone, he began bitterly to reproach himself, and remembered the text, “if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee”.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	562	He then took a sharp weapon, and stuck it into his eye, so that it burst in his head, and he never saw with it again.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	563	Thus you see he was a most holy and good man.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	564	When, therefore, the bishop had this vision, he told it to all his people, and they agreed that this shoemaker should be called before them, and when he came, they requested him to pray to God that he would make the mountain move.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	565	But when the shoemaker heard what the bishop and the others said, he answered that he was not so good a man as that God or our lady should for his sake do so great a miracle.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	566	But the Christians pressed him so earnestly, that he at last agreed, and made the prayer.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	567	When the final day was come, they all rose early in the morning, great and small, male and female; and entering the church, they sung the holy mass, and then proceeded out to the plain in front of the mountain.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	568	They were fully a hundred thousand, and they all placed themselves in front of the cross.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	569	The caliph then came with a vast number of Saracens, eager to slay the unbelievers, for they thought it impossible the hill could be moved, and they themselves were in great fear and doubt ; nevertheless they had good hope in their Creator.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	570	Then the shoemaker fell on his knees before the cross, lifted his hands to heaven, and prayed fervently that the mountain might be moved, and the Christians there assembled escape a dreadful death.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	571	When he had made his prayer, it was not long before the vast eminence began to stir, and move from its place.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	572	The Saracens, on seeing this, wondered greatly, and many of them were converted ; nay, the caliph himself became a believer in the gospel, but secretly, and when he died, a cross was found round his neck; for which reason he was not buried in the same place with the other sovereigns, but in a tomb by himself.
2	part2	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	573	Now let us leave Baldach and go to Persia.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	574	Persia isa very extensive province, anciently very rich and flourishing, but now in a great degree wasted and destroyed by the Tartars.

2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	578	One was named Balthazar, the other Gaspar, the third Melchior.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	579	Messer Marco inquired often in that city about these three magi, but no one could tell him any thing, except that they were ancient kings, who were there buried.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	580	They informed him, however, that three days’ journey farther was a tower called the Castle of the Fire-worshippers, because the men there venerate fire, and for the following reason.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	581	They say that anciently three kings of that country went to adore acertain prophet, newly born, and carried three offerings, gold, incense, and myrrh, to know if he were a king, a god, or a sage; for they said that, if he took gold, he was aking; if incense, he wasa god; if myrrh, he was a sage.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	582	They went in one after another, and though they were of different ages and fashions, he appeared to each of them exactly like himself.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	583	When they came out and compared what they had seen, they wondered much, and then went in altogether, and the child then appeared to them what he really was, a boy of thirteen days old.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	584	They presented to him the three offerings, and he took them all, whence they concluded that he was at once god, king, and sage.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	585	He presented to them a closed box, desiring them not to open it till their return home.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	586	After having travelled a number of days, however, they were curious to see what was in the box, and opened it, when they found only a stone, which was meant to express that they should remain firm in the faith which they had received.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	587	They did not understand this meaning, and despising the gift, threw it into a well, when immediately a great fire came down from heaven, and began to burn brightly.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	588	When they saw this wonder, they were quite astonished, and repented that they had thrown.
2	part2	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	589	away the stone.
