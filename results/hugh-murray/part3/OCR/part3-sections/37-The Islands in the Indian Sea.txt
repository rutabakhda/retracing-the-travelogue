You must know I have described only its noblest Kingdoms and isles; those that make the flower of the region, and to which the rest are mostly subject. No man could enumerate all the islands ; they are estimated at 12,700, inhabited and uninhabited, according to the writings of the most skilful mariners. In the Greater India, which extends from Maabar to Kesmacoran, are thirteen very great kingdoms, of which I have described ten. The Lesser India, stretching from Zinaba to Montifi, contains eight, and this is exclusive of numerous others that are in the islands.
