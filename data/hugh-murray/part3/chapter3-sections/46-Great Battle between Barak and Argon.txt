Abaga ruled many provinces bordering on those of Kaidu, and it was where grows the tree called in the book of Alexander the Arbor Secco.As that prince committed great ravages on his territory, he sent his son Argon, with a very large host of cavalry, into the country of the Arbor Secco, to the river of Gihon, where he took a station fitted to guard the country against the invader. Kaidu, however, assembled a great body of horsemen, and gave the command to a brother named Barak, very brave and skilful, desiring him to oppose the enemy. Barak, with his troops, rode on till they came to the river, and were ten miles distant from Argon. The latter, informed of the approach of his adversary, made diligent preparation ; the two remained three days in their respective camps. When they were fully prepared, and the naccar began to sound, they no longer delayed, but rushed furiously against each other. The arrows might be seen flying on all sides, and the air was so full of them, that it seemed to rain; and when both parties had discharged them, and many men as well as horses had been slain, they seized their swords and spears, and began a most fierce and cruel combat. Arms and legs were cut off, chargers killed, and many dreadful wounds inflicted ; the noise and cries were such as would have drowned the loudest thunder. I assure you, in a few hours the ground was covered with dead and dying. Finally, Barak and his men could not endure the force of their adversary, and retreated across the river ; while the victor pursued and killed a great number.Thus Argon gained the day ; and having begun to speak of him, I will relate his other adventures, and how he became sovereign lord after the death of Abaga, his father.
