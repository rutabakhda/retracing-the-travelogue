When a man travels three days, he finds a city named Scassem, which is on the plain, while the others are on the mountains, and through it flows a considerable river. There are here many porcupines, and when the hunters set their dogs upon them, the hogs collect together and push their spines against their assailants, and often hurt them severely.* This Scassem is a large province, and the shepherds dwell in caverns on the mountains, which are easily formed, being wholly of earth, and make large handsome habitations.t When aman leaves this city, he travels three days without finding a house, or any thing to eat or drink, being obliged to carry provisions with him, and he then enters the district of Badascian.
