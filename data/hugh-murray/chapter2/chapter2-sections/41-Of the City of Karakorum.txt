Karakorum isa city three miles in circuit,which was the first that the Tartars took when they issued from their country, and I am to tell you of their actions and manners, how they gained command, and spread themselves over the world. You must know that they dwelt in the north, about Ciorcia, in which region are great plains, and no abode in cities or castles, but good pasturage, large rivers, and abundance of water. They had no lords, yet paid tribute to the great sire, named in their language Unchan, whom we call Prester John, and who is spoken of over all the world. They paid to him one beast out of every ten; but they multiplied so greatly, that he became afraid of them, and resolved to separate them into different countries; for which purpose he sent his barons among them. The Tartars on hearing this were much grieved, and, holding a council, determined to flee through desert countries to the north, where he could not reach nor injure them. They then ceased to obey or pay tribute to him,and remained thus for a long time.
