When you depart from Karakorum, and from Altai, where the khans are interred, as I have related above, you go northwards through a country which is called the plain of Bangnu, and continues during a journey of forty days. The inhabitants, who are called Mecri, and are very savage, live on the flesh of animals, chiefly deer, nay I assure you that they ride upon these animals. Their customs resemble those of the Tartars, and they are subject to the great khan. They have neither corn nor wine, but in summer abundance of beasts and birds for hunting and hawking ; though in winter none remain in the country on account of the intense cold. After travelling these forty days you come to the ocean ; and there is found a mountain, where the peregrine falcons build their nests. You must know this place contains neither men nor women, nor beasts, nor any birds, except one species, which is called barghenlac, on which . the hawks feed. They are of the size of partridges, have feet like parrots, and tails like swallows, and they fly very swiftly. When the great khan wishes peregrine falcons, he sends thither for them, In an island of that sea, too, are bred the gerfalcons; and I assure you the place is so far north, that the polestar remains behind, and is seen to the south. Those birds are bred on that isle in such abundance, that the great khan obtains as many as he pleases; while others are conveyed to Argon and other lords of the East.Now that I have told you of these northern provinces as far asthe ocean, let us return to Canpicion.
