That plain extends five days’ journey southward, and you then come to a descent which continues twenty miles by a very bad and difficult road, full of wicked robbers. You then approach the very beautiful plain of Formosa, watered by fine rivers, with plantations of the date-palm, and having the air filled with francolins, parrots, and other birds unknown to our climate.You ride two days through it, and then arrive at the ocean, on which there is a city and fort named Cormos.The ships of India bring thither all kinds of spiceries, precious stones, and pearls, cloths of silk and gold, elephants’ teeth, and many other articles. It is the capital of a kingdom, having many cities and castles under it, and the sovereign is called Ruemedan Achomac, The climate, however, is intensely hot, and extremely unhealthy, and when any foreign merchant dies, the king inherits all his property. Wine is here made of dates and other spices, and is extremely good ; but when drunk by men unaccustomed to it, has a strong purgative quality, though, after some use, it agrees well, and promotescorpulence. The people live chiefly on dates and salted fish, particularly the tunny ; considering these victuals to be the most wholesome, and that if they used wheaten bread and fiesh they would fall sick. The ships are very bad, and many are lost from not being secured by nails like ours, but sewed together by a thread made of the bark of the Indian nuttrees, which being softened in water, becomes like horsehair, and is durable enough. They use it for want of iron, but it is by no means strong or secure. They have a mast, sail, and rudder, all single, and a coverlet of leather, which is spread over the goods, and on that they place the horses, many of which are transported into India. These ships, too, are not tarred, but covered with the oil of fish, The people are black, and adore Mohammed. They do not remain in the city during summer, for then they would all die, but retire to the country, where they have verdant gardens, finely watered by streams. Even there they would not escape, because there often blows from the sandy tracts that surround the city a wind so excessively hot that it would kill them all, if they did not plunge into the water and thus escape it.They sow wheat, barley, and other kinds of grain in the month of November, and reap them in March, when they become ripe and perfect ; but none except the date will endure till May, being dried up by the extreme heat. I have also to tell you, when men or women die, great grief is shown, and the ladies, during full four years after the death of their husbands, make lamentations at least once a-day. On these occasions, they assemble their relations and neighbours, who join them in loud moanings and cries. In proof of the extreme violence of the heat, Marco Polo mentions the following circumstance which occurred during his residence. The ruler of Cormos neglected to pay his tribute to the King of Creman, who took the resolution of enforcing it at the season when the principal inhabitants gointothecountry. He therefore despatched 1600 horse and 5000 foot through the district of Reobarle, to take them by surprise. Being misled, however, by the guides, they did not reach the place till night, when they halted to rest in a grove near the town. On renewing their march next morning, they were attacked by the hot wind, and all suffocated ; not one surviving to carry back the fatal intelligence. When the people of Cormos learned this event, and went to bury the dead bodies lest they should infect the air, they found them so softened by the intense heat, that the limbs, when handled, separated from the trunks ; and it was necessary to dig graves close to where the corpses lay.
