Canpicion is a great and noble town, chief and capital of the whole province of Tangut. The people are idolaters, and there are some who adore Mohammed, and also Christians who have three large and beautiful churches. The first have monasteries and abbeys according to their custom, with a very great number of idols, some of which, I assure you, are ten paces high, severally formed of wood, of earth, and of stone, all beautifully covered with gold and ivory. Their priests live more respectably than others, and guard themselves against luxury, though they do not hold it for a very great sin. They observe the lunar months like ours, and in one of them do not kill any beast or bird. For five days they eat no food that has had life, and live more strictly than usual. They take sometimes thirty wives, or as many as they have wealth to maintain, and give them a dowry in beasts, slaves, and money ; but the first wife ranks always as the principal.If any of them do not please him, she may be divorced. They marry their cousins and even the wives of their father, and do not regard as sins many things which we account great ones ; for they live like beasts : therefore let us leave them and go to the north. But I must tell you that Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco, remained in that city a year, on particular business which I need not enter into. We shall now go sixty days northwards.*
