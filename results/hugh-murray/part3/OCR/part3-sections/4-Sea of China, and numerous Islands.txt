You must know, that the gulf containing this island is called that of Zin, meaning in their language the sea opposite to Manji. According to skilful and intelligent mariners, who have made the voyage, it contains 7448 isles, mostly inhabited. In all these there grows no tree which is not agreeably fragrant, and also useful, being equal or superior in size to the lignum aloes. They produce also many and various spices, including pepper white like snow, as well as the black. They yield also much gold, and various other wonderful and costly productions ;but they are very distant and difficult to reach. The mariners of Zai-tun and Kin-sai, who visit them, gain indeed great profits; but they spend a year on the voyage, going in winter, and returning in the summer ; for the wind in these seasons blows only from two different quarters, one of which carries them thither, and the other brings them back.But this country is immensely distant from India. You may observe, too, that though the sea be called Zin, it is really the ocean, just as we say the sea of England, the sea of Rochelle. The great khan has no power over these islands. Now let us return to Zai-tun, and resume our narrative.
