1	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	588	but the former showed it openly; 								
1	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	589	for they brought before him a cane, cut in the middle, and placed the two parts on different sides, and wrote the name of Gengis on one, and of Unchan on the other, telling him, that when they had made their enchantment, he whose cane should come above that of the other would conquer in battle.
