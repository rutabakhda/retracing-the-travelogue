111	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	112	 He thought day and night how he might compel all those in his country to become converts, or else kill them.					
112	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	113	Many others concurred in that wicked purpose, and they agreed upon this plan : They found in the gospel a text saying that if a Christian had as much faith as a grain of mustard-seed and made his prayer to God, he would be able to join two mountains together.					
113	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	114	On finding this text, they felt great joy, thinking they had thus either a means of converting them, or a pretext for killing them outright.					
114	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	115	He therefore sent for all the Jacobite and Nestorian believers in his country, who were very numerous;

117	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	118	Then, continued the caliph, since so many Christians are here, there surely must be among you this small measure of faith ; 	caliph				
118	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	119	therefore, said he, pointing to a large hill in view, you must remove that mountain, or I will put you all to death, because otherwise you must be wholly destitute of faith, and on that account deserve to die.					
119	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	120	If, however, you will turn to our good law of Mohammed, you shall be forgiven; 	Mohammed			Mohammed

124	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	125	But what have I now to tell you?

127	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	128	"do you now go to a certain shoemaker with one eye, and tell him that at his prayer the mountain will be moved""ù."					
128	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	129	Now this shoemaker was a very honest and chaste man ;

132	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	133	"As soon as she was gone, he began bitterly to reproach himself, and remembered the text, ""if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee""ù."					
133	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	134	He then took a sharp weapon, and stuck it into his eye, so that it burst in his head, and he never saw with it again.					
134	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	135	Thus you see he was a most holy and good man.					
135	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	136	When, therefore, the bishop had this vision, he told it to all his people, and they agreed that this shoemaker should be called before them, and when he came, they requested him to pray to God that he would make the mountain move.					
136	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	137	But when the shoemaker heard what the bishop and the others said, he answered that he was not so good a man as that God or our lady should for his sake do so great a miracle.					
137	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	138	But the Christians pressed him so earnestly, that he at last agreed, and made the prayer.					
138	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	139	When the final day was come, they all rose early in the morning, great and small, male and female;

141	1	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	142	The caliph then came with a vast number of Saracens, eager to slay the unbelievers, for they thought it impossible the hill could be moved, and they themselves were in great fear and doubt ; 				Saracens

457	1	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	458	and no one can tell where they have gone, because the wind blowing the sand obliterates all traces of their march, and they thus escape the invader.					
458	1	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	459	But when a friendly army passes through, they send away only the beasts, because the troops would take and eat them, without any payment.

464	1	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	465	then, having taken a month's provisions and provender, they enter upon the desert, which I assure you is so extensive that if a man were to travel through its whole length, it would employ a year ; 					
465	1	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	466	and even at its smallest breadth, a month is requisite.					
466	1	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	467	It consists altogether of mountains and valleys of sand, and nothing is got to eat;

473	1	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	474	I must tell you, too, that even by day you hear these voices of spirits, and even tambours, and many other instruments sounding.					
474	1	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	475	They find it necessary, also, before going to rest at night, to fix an advanced signal, pointing out the course to be afterwards held ; 					
475	1	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	476	likewise to attach a bell to each of the animals, that they may be more easily kept from straggling.

481	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	482	they subsist not by merchandise, but by the grain which they produce from the earth.					
482	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	483	They have many abbeys and monasteries, all full of idols of various shapes, to which they offer frequent sacrifices and homage.					
483	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	484	Every man who has children rears a sheep, and at a particular festival at the end of the year, leads them along with that animal into the presence of the god, to whom they all perform reverence.					
484	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	485	They cook the sheep and offer it very humbly before the idol, leaving it while they make their prayers for the safety of their children.					
485	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	486	They then take the meat and carry it to the house, or wherever they please, send for their relations, and eat it with great joy and respect.					
486	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	487	They afterwards collect the bones, and preserve them with much diligence.					
487	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	488	You must know likewise, that when any one of them dies, his body is burned, and after he is carried to the place for this last ceremony, they erect in the middle of the path a house of cane, covered with cloths of silk and gold.					
488	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	489	When the dead man is laid before this ornamented house, they place before him wine and victuals, believing that he will be similarly honoured in the other world.					
489	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	490	At the place of burning, too, they cut in paper, men, horses, camels, and coins of the size of bezarits, convinced that the deceased will possess all these things in the future state.					
490	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	491	On this occasion, all the instruments in the land are sounded before the corpse.					
491	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	492	I must tell you, too, that after death the relations send for the astrologer, who is informed of the day, month, and year of his nativity, and then divines, by his diabolical art, the day on which the burning ought to take place.					
492	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	493	If it should be a week, a month, or six months, they keep it all that time, and never burn it till the appointed day.					
493	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	494	During this interval, they deposit it in a large box covered with cloth, and so preserved with crocus and other spices that no stench arises.					
494	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	495	Throughout this period, they place daily before the box meat and drink, and leave it there for some time, till they think he has eaten it.					
495	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	496	These sorcerers, too, often tell the relations that the dead body must not be carried out by the main door, but by a private one, or even through a breach made in the wall.					
496	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	497	All the idolaters in the world proceed in this manner.					
497	1	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	498	Now I must go to another city which lies to the south, near the extremity of this desert.

502	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	503	They are men of great gaiety, thinking of nothing but to sound musical instruments, to sing, dance, and delight their hearts. 					
503	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	504	When a stranger comes to lodge in a house, the master is highly pleased, and leaves him with his wife, desiring her to treat him in every respect as a husband, while he himself goes and spends two or three days elsewhere.

505	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	506	The women are handsome, gay, and fond of diversion.					
506	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	507	Now, when Mangou Khan reigned as sire of the Tartars, it was reported to him how the people of Kamul gave over their wives to strangers, when he sent orders that, under a severe penalty, travellers should not be henceforth entertained in this manner.

507	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	508	When they received this injunction, they were greatly grieved, held a council, and did what I will now tell you.					
508	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	509	They made up a large present, and sent it to Mangou, praying that he would allow them to treat their wives according to the custom handed down to them by their ancestors, who, for this kindness to strangers, had gained the favour of their idols, and their corn and other crops had greatly multiplied.

509	1	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	510	When he heard this message, he said, Since you are so bent on your own shame, let it be soù.

514	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	515	There is also one from which is made the salamander; 					
515	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	516	but do not suppose this is the animal so called, for no creature can live in fire, because it is compounded of the four elements.					
516	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	517	It is only through ignorance that the salamander is called an animal ; 					
517	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	518	and a Turk, named Zurficar, who was very learned, and governor of this province for three years under the great khan, being much employed in working the mines, gave me an account of it.	Zurficar,khan		Turk	Zurficar	
518	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	519	When this ore is taken from the mountain, and is broken, it strings together, and forms a thread like wool.					
519	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	520	Being then dried, pounded in a large mortar, and washed, there remains that thread of which I have spoken.					
520	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	521	Being then woven like wool, it forms cloth, which is dingy in colour at first, but when placed and left some time in the fire, it becomes white as snow, without dirt or stain.					
521	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	522	This is the truth of the salamander, and every thing else said about itis mere fable.					
522	1	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	523	I can tell you, too, that at Rome there is a cloth which the great khan sent to the pope as a costly present, and the sudarium of our Lord was placed within it.	khan,pope	Rome	Rome

530	1	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	531	They cannot, however, take this road through the mountains with any animals but those accustomed to the country, because a poisonous plant grows there, which, when eaten, causes the hoofs to drop off ; 					
531	1	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	532	but the native cattle, having learned its dangerous quality, carefully avoid it.

539	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	540	For five days they eat no food that has had life, and live more strictly than usual.					
540	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	541	They take sometimes thirty wives, or as many as they have wealth to maintain, and give them a dowry in beasts, slaves, and money ; 					
541	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	542	but the first wife ranks always as the principal.					
542	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	543	If any of them do not please him, she may be divorced.					
543	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	544	They marry their cousins and even the wives of their father, and do not regard as sins many things which we account great ones ; 					
544	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	545	for they live like beasts : therefore let us leave them and go to the north.					
545	1	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	546	But I must tell you that Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco, remained in that city a year, on particular business which I need not enter into.	Messeri Nicolo, Maffio,Marco			Messeri Nicolo ,Maffio ,Marco

567	1	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	568	yet he neither injured nor robbed the people of any thing, but placing them under leaders in whom he could confide, led them on to other triumphs.
