This is a province lying to the west, having only one king, the inhabitants idolaters, and subject to the great khan. It contains a number of cities and castles, with a lake, in which are found many pearls; but the monarch forbids them, under a severe penalty, to be removed except for his own use ; because, if any one were allowed to take them, they would become worth almost nothing. There is also a mountain, whence are quarried turquoise stones in great abundance, very large and beautiful ; but he does not allow them to be removed unless by his mandate. In this province they have a strange and base custom, that a man thinks there is no disgrace in an improper intimacy between his wife or sister and a stranger or other person. On the contrary, when such a one comes to reside in his house, the master presently goes out, and leaves him with his wife. The visiter remains often three days, and places a hat or something else at the window as a signal; and the husband never returns till he sees this taken away. This is said to be done in honour of their'idols, who on that account bestow on them many blessings. Their gold is in small rods,—the value being determined according to the weight, and not marked by any stamp. The small money is thus made: they take salt, form it into a shape, so that it weighs about halfa pound, and eighty of these are worth a rod of gold. They have a very great number of the animals which yield the musk ; likewise fishes from the same lake whence the pearls are drawn ; also the usual kinds of wild birds and beasts. No wine is obtained from vines, but it is made from grain or rice with many spices, which makes a good liquor. In that province also growsa tree called garofol; it is small, with leaves like a laurel, but longer and narrower ; it bears a small white flower.It yields ginger, cinnamon, and other spices, which come into our country ; but I have now said to you enough of Kain-du. After travelling ten days you come toa river which bounds it, named Brius. In it is found a great quantity of gold dust ; and on its banks abundance of cinnamon ; it flows on to the ocean. Now let us tell you of Caraian.
