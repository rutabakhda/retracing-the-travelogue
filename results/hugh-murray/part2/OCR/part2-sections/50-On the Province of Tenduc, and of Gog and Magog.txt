Tenduc is a province towards the east,where there are cities and castles, and the chief one bears the same name. The people belong to the great khan, like all those formerly subject to Prester John. In this province there is a king named George, descended from that prince, and who indeed enjoys his power. He holds the land under the khan, but only a part of that which was possessed by his ancestor. I assure you, however, that the khans have often given their daughters and female relations to the reigning kings of this line. In this province are found the stones whence azure is made ; they are plentiful and good. Camlets, too, are woven of camels’ hair. The natives live on cattle and the fruits of the earth, and have likewise some merchandise and manufactures, The Christians, as already mentioned, are masters of the land ;but there are also idolaters and worshippers of Mohammed. There is likewise a people called Argon, meaning in French Guasmul, that is, mixed of two different races. They are handsomer than the others, more prudent and commercial. Know that in this province was the chief. seat of Prester John, when he ruled over the Tartars and all the surrounding countries ; and this George is the sixth in succession from him. This, too, is the place which we in our country call Gog and Magog, but they call it Ung and Mungul ;and in each province was a different race of people,—in Ung were the Gog, and in Mungul dwelt the Tartars.  When a man rides through that province seven days eastward towards Cathay, he finds many cities and castles, The inhabitants are Mohammedans, idolaters, and Christians ; they carry on trade, and manufacture fine gilded cloths, called nascisi, with various kinds of silk cloth, and are subject to the great khan. There is a city named Sindacui, with many manufactures of harness and trappings necessary for an army. In the mountains of that country is a place named Idifu, where there is a very productive silver mine. They have no want éf beasts and birds for hunting. Now let us depart from this province and its cities, and travel three days, when we shall find a town named Cianganor, in which is a fine palace of the great khan [already described, p. 136].
