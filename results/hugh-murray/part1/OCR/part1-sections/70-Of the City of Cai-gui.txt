Cai-gui is a small city towards the south-east,situated upon the bank of theabove-mentioned river ; allthe people are idolaters, subject to the khan, and use paper money. Here are collected large quantities of corn and rice ; and there is a passage by water to the city of Kambalu and the court of the khan; grain from this place forms a considerable part of the provision required by hiscourt. The monarch made this communication by digging long and deep canals from one river to another, and from lake to lake, so that a large ship may pass through. And by the side of this water-channel goes a road, so that you may take either the one or the other, as is most convenient. In the middle of that river, opposite the city, is an isle of rocks, on which is a monastery of idolaters, where there are 200 monks, who serve a very great number of gods, Now, let us cross the river, and tell of a city named Cin-ghian-fu.
