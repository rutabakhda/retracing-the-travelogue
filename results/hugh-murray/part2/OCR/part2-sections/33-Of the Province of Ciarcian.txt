Ciarcian is a province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east, with a capital city of the same name. The people adore Mohammed, and have a good number of towns and castles, There is a river bringing jasper and calcedony, which, being of excellent quality, they take to sell in Cathay, and thus make great profit. This province is sandy, as well as the whole road from Cotan hither ; and much of the water is bad and bitter, but in various places it is good. When an enemy passes through the country, they flee with their wives, children, and cattle, two or three days’ journey through the sand to places abounding in fine water and pasturage ; and no one can tell where they have gone, because the wind blowing the sand obliterates all traces of their march, and they thus escape the invader. But when a friendly army passes through, they send away only the beasts, because the troops would take and eat them, without any payment.After departing from Ciarcian, you go five days through the waste, finding the water bad and bitter, but occasionally sweet and good. At the end of these five days you come to a city which lies at the commencement of the great desert, wherein provisions are laid in for its passage, and therefore I must tell you about it.
