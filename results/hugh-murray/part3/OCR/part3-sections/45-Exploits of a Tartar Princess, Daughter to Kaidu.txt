This young lady was in Tartar named Aigiarm, which means in our language “ brilliant moon.” She such strength that none of the youths or nobles in the whole kingdom could vanquish her, but were all beaten. Her father wished to marry her to a baron; but she refused ever to unite herself to any one who could not vanquish her in fair combat; and the king granted her this privilege. She rejoiced greatly, and published through various parts of the world, that if any gentle youth would come, try her in pitched battle, and gain the victory, she would accept him for her lord. This news was spread wide through the surrounding countries, and I assure you many gentlemen came and made the trial, which was arranged in the following manner. The king, with many young nobles and ladies, assembled in the great hall of the palace, when the princess entered in a robe of cotton richly adorned, attended by youths similarly attired. The agreement was, that if the candidate prevailed and threw her to the ground, he should have her for his wife; but if victory declared on her side, he was to give her a hundred horses. Thus she had gained above ten thousand steeds, because she could find no youth or damosel that could overcome her ; nor was this wonderful, for she was large, tall, and wellformed in her limbs, indeed almost a giantess. Now, about the year 1280, there came the son of a rich king, an extremely handsome young man, with a brilliant retinue and a thousand very fine horses. He addressed himself to Kaidu, who was very desirous of marrying him to his daughter. He therefore caused her to be privately dealt with, to allow herself to be conquered; but she declared she would not do so for any thing in the world. One day then, the king and queen, with many nobles and ladies, assembled in the great hall; the princess and prince then entered, and their handsome appearance struck all with wonder; he was really so strong and powerful, that no one else could contend with him. When they were in the middle of the hall before this great assembly, the agreement was formally made, that the suitor, if vanquished, should lose his thousand horses. But all the company, as well as the king and queen, expressed their wishes that he should be successful. The two then rushed together, and wrestled violently, dragging each other in different directions: but at last the lady prevailed, and threw him on the ground, to the great grief of all the spectators; he thus forfeited the thousand horses. But I have to inform you, that Kaidu led this daughter to many battles, and in no encounter could any warrior withstand her. On many orrasions, she rushed among the enemy, seized one of the chiefs, and dragged him over to her own army. I will now, however, proceed to a great battle fought between her father and Argon, the son of Abaga, lord of the East.
