Persia isa very extensive province, anciently very rich and flourishing, but now in a great degree wasted and destroyed by the Tartars. It contains a city called Sava, whence the three magi came to adore Jesus Christ when born at Bethlehem. In that city are buried the three, in separate tombs, above which is a square house carefully preserved. Their hearts are still entire, with their hair and beards.One was named Balthazar, the other Gaspar, the third Melchior. Messer Marco inquired often in that city about these three magi, but no one could tell him any thing, except that they were ancient kings, who were there buried. They informed him, however, that three days’ journey farther was a tower called the Castle of the Fire-worshippers, because the men there venerate fire, and for the following reason. They say that anciently three kings of that country went to adore acertain prophet, newly born, and carried three offerings, gold, incense, and myrrh, to know if he were a king, a god, or a sage; for they said that, if he took gold, he was aking; if incense, he wasa god; if myrrh, he was a sage. They went in one after another, and though they were of different ages and fashions, he appeared to each of them exactly like himself. When they came out and compared what they had seen, they wondered much, and then went in altogether, and the child then appeared to them what he really was, a boy of thirteen days old. They presented to him the three offerings, and he took them all, whence they concluded that he was at once god, king, and sage. He presented to them a closed box, desiring them not to open it till their return home. After having travelled a number of days, however, they were curious to see what was in the box, and opened it, when they found only a stone, which was meant to express that they should remain firm in the faith which they had received. They did not understand this meaning, and despising the gift, threw it into a well, when immediately a great fire came down from heaven, and began to burn brightly. When they saw this wonder, they were quite astonished, and repented that they had thrown. away the stone. They however took a portion of the fire, carried it to their country, and placed it in their church, where they kept it continually burning. They revere it as a god, and use it for burning all their sacrifices ; and when at any time it goes out, they repair to that well, where the fire is never extinguished,and from it bring a fresh supply. This is what all the people of that country tell, and Messer Marco was assured of it by those of the castle, and therefore it is truth. One of these kings was of Saba, the other of Ava, the other of the castle. Now let me tell you of Persia, its cities, and the actions and customs of the people.
