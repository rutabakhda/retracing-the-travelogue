1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	Having described to you the palaces, I will tell you of the great city of Cathay, which contains them.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	Near it is another large and splendid one, also named Kambalu, which means in our language city of the lord; but the monarch, finding by astrology that this town would rebel, built another near it, divided only by a river, and bearing the same name, to which its inhabitants were compelled to remove.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	It forms a regular square, six miles on each side, and thus twenty-four miles in circumference.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	It is surrounded by walls of earth, ten paces thick and twenty in height; yet the upper part becomes gradually thinner, so that at top the breadth is only three paces.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	There are twelve gates, each containing an edifice, making one in each square of that wall, and filled with men, who guard the place.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	The streets are so broad and so straight that from one gate another is visible.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	It contains many beautiful houses and palaces, and a very large one in the midst, containing a steeple with a large bell, which at night sounds three times ; after which no man must leave the city without some urgent necessity, as of sickness, or a woman about to beara child.
1	PART 1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	At each gate a thousand men keep guard, not from dread of any enemy, but in reverence of the monarch who dwells within it, and to prevent injury by robbers.
1	PART 1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	When the monarch comes to his chief city, he remains in his noble palace three days and no more, when he holds a great court, making high festival and Tejoicing with his ladies.
1	PART 1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	There is a vast abundance of people through all the suburbs of Kambalu, which are twelve in number, one corresponding to each gate ; no one can count the number of residents ; and they contain as stately edifices as any in the city, except the king’s Palace.
1	PART 1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	No one is allowed to be buried within the city ; and no females of bad character can reside there, but must have their dwellings in the suburbs, where there are said to be no fewer than 20,000.

1	PART 1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	Numerous merchants, likewise, bring more than a thousand wagons laden with grain; and all who are within a hundred miles of the city come thither to purchase what they want.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	I will hereafter particularly mention a council of twelve persons, having power to dispose at will of the lands, governments, and all things belonging to the state.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	One of these, a Saracen, named Achmac, had acquired an extraordinary influence with the great khan ; indeed his master was so infatuated with him that he allowed him the most uncontrolled license.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	It was even discovered after his death that he had employed spells to fascinate the khan, and compel him to give full credit to what was told him by his favourite, who was thus enabled to conduct public affairs according to his pleasure.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He disposed of all the commands and public offices; passed sentence upon offenders; and when desirous to inflict an injury on any one whom he hated, needed only to go to the emperor and say, “such a man has been guilty of an offence against your majesty, and deserves death”.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The monarch usually replied, do as you judge best, and Achmac then ordered him to be immediately executed.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	So manifest were the proofs of his influence, and of the sovereign’s implicit reliance on his statements, that no one dared to contradict him on any occasion ; even those highest in office stood in awe of him.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Any one charged by him with a capital offence, whatever means he might employ to justify himself and refute the accusation, could not find an advocate ; for none dared to oppose the purpose of Achmac.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Thus  he caused unjustly the death of many, and was also enabled to indulge his unlawful propensities.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Whenever he saw a woman who pleased him, he contrived either to add her to the number of his wives, or to lead her into a criminal intimacy.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	On receiving information of any man having a beautiful daughter, he despatched emissaries with instructions to say to him, “ what are your views with regard to this handsome girl?
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	the best thing you can do is to give her to the lord-vicegerent ;” for so they termed Achmac, implying that he was his majesty’s representative ; “we will induce him to appoint you to a certain government or office for three years”.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The father was thus tempted to give away his child ; and as soon as the affair was arranged, the other went and informed the emperor that a government was vacant, or would become so on a particular day, and recommended the parent as well qualified to discharge its duties.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	His majesty consented; and the appointment was immediately made.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Thus, either through ambition to hold high office, or dread of his power, he obtained possession of the fairest females, under the denomination of wives or of concubines.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Besides, he had twentyfive sons, who held the highest offices in the state, and, availing themselves of his authority, were guilty of similar violent and licentious proceedings.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He had likewise accumulated great wealth, since every one who obtained an appointment found it requisite to make him a liberal present.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	During a period of twenty-two years, he exercised this absolute authority.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	At length the Kataians, natives of the country, unable to endure longer his multiplied acts of injustice and violation of domestic rights, began to devise means of bringing about his death and the overthrow of the government.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Among the leading persons in this plot wasChenku, a commander of 6000 men, in whose family his dissolute conduct had spread dishonour.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He proposed the measure to one of his nation, named Vanku, who commanded 10,000 men, and suggested for its execution the period when the great khan, having completed his three months’ residence in Kambalu, should have departed for his palace at Shandu, while his son Gengis had also retired to the place usually visited by him at that season.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The charge of the city was then intrusted.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	to Achmac, who communicated all affairs that occurred.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	during his master’s absence, and received the necessary instructions.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Vanku and Chenku, having thus consulted together, imparted the design to some leading persons among the Kataians, and also to their friends in various other cities.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	They formed an agreement, that on a certain day, immediately on perceiving a signal made by fire, they should rise and put to death all persons wearing beards, This distinction was made because they themselves naturally wanted this appendage, which characterized the Tartars, the Saracens, and the Christians.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The grand khan, having acquired the sovereignty of Kataia, not by any legitimate right, but solely by force of arms, placed no confidence in the natives, and therefore intrusted ail the provincial governments to Tartars, Saracens, Christians, and other foreigners belonging to his household.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	From this cause his reign was universally detested by the people, who found themselves treated as slaves by the Tartars, and still worse by the Saracens.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Vanku and Chenku, having thus arranged their plans, succeeded at night in entering the palace; when the former placed himself on one of the royal seats, made the apartment be lighted up, and sent a messenger to Achmac, then residing in the old city.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He professed to come from Gengis, the emperor’s son, who, he said, had unexpectedly arrived, and required his immediate attendance.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The viceroy was much surprised by this intelligence ; but, as he stood in awe of the prince, he presently obeyed.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	On passing the gate of the new city, he met the Tartar officer named Kogatai, who commanded the guard of 12,000 men, and who asked him whither he ‘was going at that late hour.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He stated his intention of waiting upon Gengis, whose arrival had just been announced to him.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	“It is very surprising,” said the officer, “how he should have come so secretly that I was not apprized of it, 0 as to send a party of guards to attend him”.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The two Kataians, meantime, felt confident, that if they could succeed in despatching Achmac, they had nothing farther to fear.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	On entering the palace, and seeing so many lights blazing, he prostrated himself before Vanku, whom he supposed to be the prince, when Chenku, who held a sword ready in his hand, severed his head from his body.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Kogatai had stopped at the door ; but, seeing this catastrophe, he exclaimed that treason was at work, and presently discharged an arrow, which slew Vanku as he sat upon the throne.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He then caused his men to seize the other, and despatched an order to the city to kill every one who should be found abroad.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The Kataians, however, seeing the conspiracy discovered, one of their chiefs killed, and the survivor a prisoner, remained in their houses, and could not make the concerted signals to the other towns.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Kogatai lost no time in sending messengers with a particular relation of these events to the khan, who, in reply, ordered him diligently to investigate the conspiracy, and to punish according to the degree of their guilt those found implicated in it.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Next day, after receiving this command, he examined all the Kataians, and inflicted the punishment of death on the Tingleaders.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Other cities known to have participated in the guilt suffered similar inflictions.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	When his majesty returned to Kambalu, he inquired eagerly into the cause of this disturbance, and learned that the infamous Achmac and seven of his sons (the others being less culpable) had committed several enormities, He gave orders that the treasure, which he had accumulated to an incredible amount, should be removed from his place of residence to the new city, where it was lodged in his own treasury.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	He directed even that his corpse should be disinterred, and thrown into the street, where the dogs might tear it in pieces.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	The sons, who had pursued the same criminal course with their father, were ordered to be flayed alive.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Considering also the principles of the accursed sect of the Saracens, which allow them to indulge in the commission of every crime, and even to murder those who differ from them on points of belief, whence even the detestable Achmac and his sons might have imagined themselves guiltless, he regarded the whole body with contempt and abomination.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Summoning them to his presence, he forbade the continuance of many practices enjoined in their law, ordering that in future their marriages should be arranged according to the Tartar custom ; and that, in killing animals for food, instead of cutting their throats, they should rip open the stomach.
1	PART 1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	Marco Polo was on the spot when these events took place.
1	PART 1	14	Guards of the Great Khan	When the great khan holds a court, he is guarded, on account of his excellency and honour, by 12,000 horsemen, who are called quiesitan, that is, faithful servants of their lord; and this he does not from fear but regard to his high dignity.
1	PART 1	14	Guards of the Great Khan	Over these 12,000 are four captains, so that each commands 3000; and they keep guard in turn three days and three nights, eating and drinking at the expense of the prince.
1	PART 1	14	Guards of the Great Khan	Then they go away, and another party comes ; and so they proceed throughout the whole year.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	When the khan wishes to celebrate a splendid festival, the tables are so arranged that his is much higher than the others, and he sits on the north, with his face toward the south.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	His first wife is seated beside him on the left, while, on the right, are his sons and nephews, and all those of imperial lineage, who are so stationed that their head is on a level with the feet of the monarch.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	The barons sit still lower; while the ladies, daughters, and female relations of the khan are placed beneath the queen on the left side, and under them all the wives of the barons ; every class knows the spot where they ought to sit.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	The tables are so arranged that the monarch can see all the company, who are very numerous ; and outside of that hall there eat more than 40,000 persons, who have come with presents or remarkable objects from foreign parts, and attend on the days when he holds a court or celebrates a marriage.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	In the midst of this hall is a very large vessel of fine gold, containing wine, and on each side two smaller ones, whence the liquor is poured out into flagons, each containing fully enough for eight men ; and one of these is placed between every two guests, who have besides separate cups of gold to drink out of.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	This supply of plate is of very great value, and indeed the khan has so many vessels of gold and silver that none without seeing could possibly believe it.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	At each door of the great hall, or of any part of the palace occupied by his majesty, stand two officers of gigantic height, holding in their hands staves, to prevent persons who enter from touching the threshold.

1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	As strangers may not be aware of this prohibition, officers are appointed to warn them of it at the time of introduction.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	Since, however, some of the company, on leaving the hall, may be so affected with liquor as to be unable to guard against the accident, it is not then severely punished.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	Those who serve the khan at table are great barons, who hold their mouths carefully wrapped in rich towels of silk and gold, that their breath may not blow upon the dishes.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	When he begins to drink, all the instruments, which are very numerous, are sounded, and while the cup is in his hand, the barons and others present fall on their knees, and make signs of great humility ; this is done every time he drinks, or when new viands are brought in.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	These I shall not attempt to recount, since any one may believe that he will have the greatest variety of beasts and birds, wild and domestic, and of fishes in their season, and in the greatest abundance, prepared most delicately in various modes suitable to his magnificence and dignity.
1	PART 1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	Every baron or knight brings his wife, and she sits at table along with the other ladies, When the great sire has eaten, and the tables are removed, a number of jesters, players, and other witty persons perform various pieces, exciting much mirth and pleasure among the company, who then all depart and go to their homes.

1	PART 1	20	Leopards and other wild Animals kept for Hunting	He has also many lions larger than those of Babylon, of a beautiful hair and colour, striped lengthways, black, red, and white, and trained to catch stags, wild-oxen, hogs, wild-goats, and asses ; and it is delightful to see one of these chases, where the hunters go out, carrying the lion in a cage, and with him a amall dog.
1	PART 1	20	Leopards and other wild Animals kept for Hunting	They have likewise abundance of eagles, with which they capture hares, foxes, and even wolves; those which are trained to catch these last are very large, and of great weight, so that no wolf can escape them.
1	PART 1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	Now let us speak of the dogs kept by this monarch.
1	PART 1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	He has two barons who are brothers, named Bayam and Migam ; they are called cinuci, that is, the keepers of mastiff dogs, and each commands a party of 10,000 men, one clothed in vermilion, and the other in blue; whenever they go out with the monarch they are dressed in these vestments.
1	PART 1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	In each party there are 2000 of the men, who guide respectively one, two, or more large mastiffs, making altogether a vast multitude.
1	PART 1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	When his majesty goes to hunt, these two brothers attend him on opposite sides, each with 10,000 men and 5000 dogs; and they hunt thus a day’s journey distant from each other, and never pursue any animal which is not captured.
1	PART 1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	It is indeed beautiful to see the speed of these dogs and the hunters, for when the prince goes out with his barons, boars and other animals are running on every side, and the dogs pursuing.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	When the monarch has remained in Kambalu these three months, he departs and goes southward to the ocean two days’ journey distant.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	He leads with him 10,000 falconers, conveying full 5000 gerfalcons, peregrine falcons in abundance, and also many vultures; but do not imagine that these are all kept in one place ; there are 200 here, 300 there, and so on.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	The birds caught are mostly presented to the great sire, and when he goes to hunt with his gerfalcons, vultures, and falcons, 10,000 men are ranged, two together, so as to enclose much ground ; these are called toscaor, meaning in our language men who remain on the watch, and each has a call and a hood to invite the birds.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	And when any falconer, by order of his majesty, sends forth u falcon, he has no need to follow it, because wherever it may go, it is watched by the men ranged in double order, who can either catch it again, or if necessary afford it succour.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	Each of the birds belonging to the sovereign and barons has a tablet of silver on its feet, with its name and that of the owner inscribed, so that wherever caught, it can be returned to him.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	If he is unknown, the animal must be carried to a chief named bulangazi, or guardian of things that are lost, who stands with his flag on an elevated spot, and all who have missed any thing go to him and recover it.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	Whoever finds a horse, a bird, a sword, or any thing else, and does not carry it to the owner or to this officer, is treated as a robber; thus scarcely any thing is ever lost.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	When the monarch goes upon these excursions, he has with him four elephants, and a chamber prepared, covered within with cloth of beaten gold, and outwardly with lions’ skins, where he keeps twelve of his very best gerfalcons, with twelve barons to amuse him by their society.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	As the falconers ride by, they call, “Sire, the birds are passing,” when he throws open the chamber, and seeing the object, selects the gerfalcons that please him, and sends them forth against the birds, few of which ever escape.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	Lying on his couch, he can view and enjoy the chase.
1	PART 1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	Thus, I think, there is not, and never will be, any lord in the world, who has or can have so much diversion as the great khan.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	When this mighty monarch comes to one of his places, named Chaccia, he causes his tents to be pitched, with those of his sons and barons.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	These exceed 10,000 in number, and are very beautiful and rich.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	That in which he keeps his court is so large that 1000 knights can dwell in it; this is for his nobles and other attendants.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	He himself resides in another, looking westward, where those to whom he wishes to speak are introduced ; while there is an interior chamber in which he sleeps.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	The two halls have each three fine columns of aromatic wood, and are covered outwardly with beautiful lions’ hides, all striped with black, white, and vermilion, so that water cannot enter.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	The inside is lined with skins of ermine and zibelline, of the highest value, especially the latter, of which a robe suitable for a man would be worth 2000 golden bezants, while a common one would be worth 1000.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	The Tartars call them royal skins, and they are as large as those of a fawn; the whole hall is covered with them, worked most delicately in intaglio.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	These apartments contain furniture of such value that a little king could not purchase them.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	Around are large tents for his ladies, and for his gerfalcons and other beasts and birds; for he brings all his train, doctors, astronomers, hunters, and other officials, so that the whole appears a large and crowded city.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	He remains there till the feast of the Resurrection, during which time he does nothing but chase cranes, swans, and other birds, when those who catch any bring them to him, and thus the sport is beyond what any one can describe.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	No baron, nor lord, nor husbandman, can keep a dog or falcon for twenty days’ journey round his residence ; beyond that distance they may do what they please.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	No person, too, of whatever condition, must, from March to October, take any game, but leave them to multiply their kind ; so that hares and stags become so fearless as frequently to come up to men, yet are not taken.
1	PART 1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	The great khan then returns to the city of Kambalu by the same road, hawking and sporting.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	At Shandu in Tartary, near the western frontier of China, he has built a very large palace of marble and other valuable stones.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	The halls are gilded all over and wonderfully beautiful, and a space sixteen miles in circuit is surrounded by a wall, within which are fountains, rivers, and meadows.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Here he finds stags, deer, and wild-goats to give for food to the falcons and gerfalcons, which he keeps in cages, and goes out once a-week to sport with them.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Frequently he rides through that enclosure, having a leopard on the crupper of his horse, which, whenever he is inclined, he lets go, and it catches a stag, deer, or wild-goat, which is given to the gerfalcons in the cage.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	In this park, too, the monarch has a large palace framed of cane, the interior gilded all over, having pictures of beasts and birds most skilfully worked on it.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	The roof is of the same material, and so richly varnished that no water can penetrate.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	I assure you these canes are more than three palms thick, and from ten to fifteen paceslong.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	They are cut lengthways, from onc knot to the other, and then arranged so as to form the roof.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	The whole structure is so disposed that the khan, when he pleases, can order it to be taken down, for it is supported by more than 200 cords of silk.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	His majesty remains there three months of the year, June, July, and August, the situation being cool and agreeable ; and during this period his palace of cane is set up, while all the rest of the year it is down.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	On the 28th of August, he departs thence, and for the following purpose :—There are a race of mares white as snow, with no mixture of any other colour, and in number 10,000, whose milk must not be drunk by any one who is not of imperial lineage.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Only one other race of men can drink it, called Boriat, because they gained a victory for Gengis Khan.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	When one of these white animals is passing, the Tartars pay respect to it as to a great lord, standing by to make way for it.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	The astrologers and idolaters, too, have told the khan, that on the 28th August this milk must be sprinkled through the air, and over the earth, that the spirits may drink plentifully, and may preserve all that belong to him, men, women, beasts, birds, and other things.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	But there is a wonderful circumstance that I had forgotten.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	When the monarch remained in that palace, and there came on rain, fog, or any bad weather, he had skilful astronomers and enchanters, who made these mischiefs fly away from his palace, so that none of them could approach it.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	These wise men are called Tebet and Quesmur ;they are idolaters, and more skilful in diabolical arts and enchantments than any other generation; and though they do it by the art of the devil, they make other men believe that it is through their great sanctity and by the power of God.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	t I must tell you, too, another of their customs, that when any man is judged and condemned to death by his lord, they cook and eat him, but not when he dies a natural death.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	t I will tell you, too, a great wonder which these bakst do by their enchantments.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	When the monarch sits at table in his hall of state, and the cups are ten paces distant, full of wine, milk, and other beverages, they cause them, by their magical spells, to rise from the pavement and place themselves before the prince, without any one touching them ; this is done in the presence of 10,000 men ; and the fact is real and true, without any lie.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	These baksi, when the festivals of their idols come round, go to his majesty and say, “ Great sire, you know the feast of such an idol approaches, and are aware that he can cause bad weather and much mischief to your cattle and grain.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	We pray, therefore, that you will give us all the sheep with black heads, also incense, aloe-wood, and such and such other things”.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	This they tell to the barons, who repeat it to the khan, and he gives what they demand.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Then they goto the image and raise in his presence a delicious fragrance, with incense and spices, cook the flesh, and place it with bread before him.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Thus every god has his day of commemoration in the same manner as our saints.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	They have also extensive abbeys and monasteries, one of which here resembles a little city, containing upwards of 2000 monks, who are clothed in a particular dress, which is handsomer than that of other men.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	They worship their idols by the grandest feasts, songs, and lights that ever were seen.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	And I may tell you that many of these baksi, according to their order, may take wives, do so, and have a number of children.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Yet there is another kind of religious men called sensi, who observe strict abstinence ; they eat nothing but the husks of corn boiled in warm water, fast often in the course of the year, have many large idols, and sometimes adore fire.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Their observances differ from those of every other sect ; they would not take a wife for any thing in the world.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	They shave the head and beard, wear black and blue dresses of coarse canvass, sleep upon mats, and lead the hardest life of any men on earth.
1	PART 1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	Their monasteries and their idols all bear the names of women.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	At Cianganor, too, three days’ journey distant, the khan has a large palace, where he is fond of residing, because there are many lakes and rivers, as well as fine plains, abounding in cranes, pheasants, partridges, and other birds.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	Here, therefore, he has delightful hawking, and abundant exercise for his falcons and gerfalcons.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	There are five kinds of cranes which I must describe.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	The first are black like crows, and very large.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	The second are white, and very beautiful, for all the feathers are full of round eyes, like those of the peacock, and glitter like gold.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	The head is white, black, and red all round, and they are larger than any of the others.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	The third species resemble ours.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	The fourth are small, and have in their ears very magnificent red and black feathers.
1	PART 1	25	Palace at Cianganor	The fifth are all gray, with handsome red and black heads, and are very large.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	With regard to the money of Kambalu, the great khan may be called a perfect alchymist, for he makes it himself.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	He orders people to collect the bark of a certain tree, whose leaves are eaten by the worms that spin silk.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	The thin rind between the bark and the interior wood is taken, and from it cards are formed like those of paper, all black.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	He then causes them to be cut into pieces, and each is declared worth respectively half a livre, a whole one, asilver grosso of Venice, and so on to the value of ten bezants.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	All these cards are stamped with his seal, and so many are fabricated, that they would buy all the treasuries in the world.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	He makes all his payments in them, and circulates them through the kingdoms and provinces over which he holds dominion ; and none dares to refuse them under pain of death.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	All the nations under his sway receive and pay this money for their merchandise, gold, silver, precious stones, and whatever they transport, buy, or sell, The merchants often bring to him goods worth 400,000 bezants, and he pays them all in these cards, which they willingly accept, because they can make purchases with them throughout the whole empire.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	He frequently commands those who have gold, silver, cloths of silk and gold, or other precious commodities, to bring them to him.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	Then he calls twelve men skilful in these matters, and commands them to look at the articles, and fix their price.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	Whatever they name is paid in these cards, which the merchant cordially receives.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	In this manner the great sire possesses all the gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones in his dominions.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	When any of the cards are torn or spoiled, the owner carries them to the place whence they were issued, and receives fresh ones, with a deduction of 3 per cent.
1	PART 1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	If a man wishes gold or silver to make plate, girdles, or other ornaments, he goes to the office, carrying a sufficient number of cards, and gives them in payment for the quantity which he requires, This is the reason why the khan has more treasure than any other lord in the world; nay, all the princes in the world together have not an equal amount.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	He has appointed twelve very great barons, who hold command over all things in the thirty-four provinces.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	They reside in a palace within the city of Kambalu, large and beautiful, containing many halls and apartments ; and for every province there is an agent and a number of writers or notaries, having each a house to himself.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	They manage all the provincial affairs according to the will and pleasure of the twelve barons.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	The latter have power to appoint the lords of the provinces above mentioned ; and having chosen the one whom they judge best qualified, they name him to the great khan, who confirms him, and bestows a golden tablet corresponding to his command.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	These twelve barons are called in the Tartar language scieng, that is, the greater officers of state.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	They order the army to go where and in what numbers they please, but all according to the commands of the great sire ; and they do every other thing necessary for the provinces.
1	PART 1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	The palace in which they dwell is called scien, and is the largest in all the court; they have the power of doing much good to any one whom they favour.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	I must now inform you, that from the city of Kambalu, many messengers are sent to divers provinces, and on all the roads they find, at every twenty-five miles, a post called jamb, where the imperial envoys are received.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	At each is a large edifice, containing a bed covered with silk, and every thing useful and convenient for a traveller ; so that ifa king were to come, he would be well accommodated.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	Here, too, they find full 400 horses whom the prince has ordered to be always in waiting to convey them when sent into any quarter, along the principal roads.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	When they have to go through any district where there is no habitation, the monarch has caused such edifices to be reared at the distance of thirty-five or at most forty miles; thus they go through all the provinces, finding every where inns and horses for their reception.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	This is the greatest establishment that ever was kept by any king or emperor in the world ; for at those places there are maintained more than 200,000 horses.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	Also the edifices, furnished and prepared in the manner now described, amount to more than 10,000.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	Moreover, in the intervals between these stations, at every three miles, are erected villages of about forty houses, inhabited by foot-runners, also employed on these despatches, They wear a large girdle, set round with bells, which are heard at a great distance.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	‘When one of them receives a letter or packet, he runs full speed to the next village, where his approach being announced by the bells, another is ready to start and proceed to the next, and soon.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	By these pedestrian messengers the khan receives news in one day and night from places distant ten days’ journey; in two, from those distant twenty ; and in ten, from those distant a hundred.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	t From them he exacts no tribute, but gives them horses and many other things.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	When his messengers go on horseback to carry intelligence into the provinces or bring tidings from distant parts, and, more especially, respecting any district that has rebelled, they ride in one day and night 200, 260, or even 300 miles ; and when there are two, they receive two good horses, bind themselves round the head and body, and gallop fall speed from one station to the next at twentyfive miles’ distance, where they find two others fresh and ready harnessed, on which they proceed with the same rapidity.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	They stop not for an instant day nor night, and are thus enabled to bring news in so short a period.
1	PART 1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	Now, I will tell you the great bounty which the monarch bestows twice in the year.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	He sends his messengers through all his kingdoms and provinces, to know if any of his subjects have had their crops injured through bad weather or any other disaster ; and if such injury has happened, he does not exact from them any tribute for that season or year ; nay, he gives them corn out of his own stores to subsist upon, and to sow their fields.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	This he does in summer ; in winter he inquires if there has been a mortality among the cattle, and in that case grants similar exemption and aid.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	When there is a great abundance of grain, he causes magazines to be formed, to contain wheat, rice, millet, or barley, and care to be taken that it be not lost or spoiled ; then when a scarcity occurs, this grain is drawn forth, and sold for a third or fourth of the current price.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	Thus there cannot be any severe famine ; for he does it through all his dominions; he bestows also great charity on many poor families in Kambalu ; and when he hears of individuals who have not food to eat, he causes grain to be given tothem.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	Bread is not refused at the court throughout the whole year to any who come to beg for it; and on this account he is adored as a god by his people.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	His majesty provides them also with raiment out of his tithes of wool, silk, and hemp.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	These materials he causes to be woven into different sorts of cloth, in a house erected for that purpose, where every artisan is obliged to work one day in the week for his service.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	Garments made of the stuffs thus manufactured are given to destitute families for their winter and summer dresses, A dress is also prepared for his armies ; and in every city a quantity of woollen cloth is woven, being defrayed from the tithes there levied.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	It must be observed, that the Tartars, according to their original customs, when they had not yet adopted the religion of the idolaters, never bestowed alms ; but when applied to by any necessitous person, repelled him with reproachful expressions, saying,— begone with your complaints of a bad season, God has sent it to you, and had he loved you, as he evidently loves me, you would have similarly prospered.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	But since some of the wise men among the idolaters, especially the baksi, have represented to his majesty, that to provide for the poor is a good work and highly grateful to their deities, he has bestowed charity in the manner now described, so that, at his court, none are denied food who come to ask for it.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	He has also so arranged that in all the highways by which messengers, merchants, and other persons travel, trees are planted at short distances on both sides of the road, and are so tall that they can be seen from a great distance.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	They serve thus both to show the way and afford a grateful shade.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	This is done whenever the nature of the soil admits of plantation ; but when the route lies through sandy deserts or over rocky mountains, he has ordered stones to be set up, or columns erected, to guide the traveller.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	Officers of rank are appointed, whose duty it is to take care that these matters be properly arranged, and the roads kept constantly in good order.
1	PART 1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	Besides other motives, the great khan is influenced by the declaration of his soothsayers and astrologers, that those who plant trees receive long life as their reward.
1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	When Kublai learned these things, he was not at all alarmed, but declared, that he wished he might never wear a crown, nor hold sway over a kingdom, if he did not bring the traitors to an evil death.
1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	He therefore made his whole army be prepared in twenty-two days, and so secretly, that nothing was known beyond his own council.
1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	He raised full 360,000 mounted soldiers, and 100,000 infantry ; and the reason of their number not being greater, was, that they consisted only of his huntsmen, and those immediately round his person, the rest being employed in carrying on distant wars ; for if he could have assembled his whole host, the multitude would have been such as no man could have numbered.
1	PART 1	3	Kublai prepares to meet him	He then called his astrologers, and asked of them if he would be victorious ; they answered, that he would do to his enemies according to his pleasure.
1	PART 1	30	Liquor used for Wine in Cathay	You must know that the greater part of the people of Cathay drink a wine made of rice and many good spices, and prepare it in such a way that it is more agreeable to drink than any other liquid.
1	PART 1	30	Liquor used for Wine in Cathay	It is clear and beautiful, and it makes a man drunk sooner than any other wine, for it is extremely hot.
1	PART 1	31	Stones which are burnt instead of Wood	It may be observed, also, that throughout the whole province of Cathay, there are a kind of black stones cut from the mountains in veins, which burn like logs.
1	PART 1	31	Stones which are burnt instead of Wood	They maintain the fire better than wood.
1	PART 1	31	Stones which are burnt instead of Wood	If you put them on in the evening, they will preserve it the whole night, and will be found burning in the morning.
1	PART 1	31	Stones which are burnt instead of Wood	Throughout the whole of Cathay this fuel is used.
1	PART 1	31	Stones which are burnt instead of Wood	t They have also wood indeed ; but the stones are much less expensive.
1	PART 1	32	The Astrologers of Kambalu—the Tartar Computation of Time	The city of Kambalu contains, inclusive of Christians, Saracens, and Kataians, about 5000 astrologers and soothsayers, whom the emperor provides with food and clothing, as he does the poor families; and they are constantly practising their art.
1	PART 1	32	The Astrologers of Kambalu—the Tartar Computation of Time	They have astrolabes, on which are delineated the planetary signs, the hours of passing the meridian, and their successive aspects during the whole year.
1	PART 1	32	The Astrologers of Kambalu—the Tartar Computation of Time	The astrologers of each separate sect annually examine their respective tables, to ascertain thence the course of the heavenly bodies, and their relative positions for every lunation.

1	PART 1	45	The Province of Kain-du	It contains a number of cities and castles, with a lake, in which are found many pearls; but the monarch forbids them, under a severe penalty, to be removed except for his own use ; because, if any one were allowed to take them, they would become worth almost nothing.

1	PART 1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	When a man leaves Yaci, or Chiaci, and goes ten days westward, he finds the province of Karazan, with a capital of the same name.

1	PART 1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	There are smaller ones eight paces long and six palms broad.
1	PART 1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	The mode of catching them is this :—They remain during the day in great caverns under the earth, to avoid the heat, but at night go out to feed, and seize all the animals whom they can reach; they also seek drink at the rivers, fountains, and lakes, and then make a deep track in the sand, as if a barrel had been dragged through it.
1	PART 1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	In it the people fix a stake, fasten to it a steel instrument sharpened like a razor, and cover it over with sand.

1	PART 1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	This was not out of enmity or with the view of taking his money, but because they imagined that his wisdom and other good qualities would thus remain with them.
1	PART 1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	However, about thirty-five years ago, after that monarch conquered the country, he prohibited this crime, which, from fear of him, they no longer commit.

1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	They have neither letters nor writing, which is not wonderful, because they live in an unfrequented place, that cannot be visited in the summer on account of the air, which is then so corrupted and pestilent that no foreigner can live there.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	Whenever they have dealings together, they select a piece of timber, square or round, cleave it in the middle, and each takes a half; this must be done before two, three, or four witnesses.

1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	In all those provinces there is no physician, but when any one is sick, doctors and exorcists of evil spirits are sent for, who, on coming to the patient, begin their incantations, beating instruments, singing and dancing.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	Ina short time one of them falls to the ground, foams at the mouth, and becomes half-dead, when the devil enters into his body.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	The other magicians then ask the half-dead man what is the cause of the patient’s illness.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	The demon answers from his mouth that the sufferer has given displeasure to such or such a spirit, who is therefore tormenting him.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	They then say, “ we beseech you to pardon him, and take in compensation for his blood the presents which we now exhibit,” Then if the sick man is to die, the fiend in the body of the magician says, — the spirit has been wronged and displeased to such a degree, that he will not spare him for any thing in the world”.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	If on the contrary a cure is to take place, the devil from the body says, “ take so many sheep and so many dishes of rich pottage, and make a sacrifice of them to the angry spirit”.

1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	It is then answered that he is not yet pardoned, but something more must be done, after which forgiveness will be granted.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	This order is obeyed, when he says, “ he is pardoned, and will be immediately cured”.
1	PART 1	48	The Province of Kardandan	The company then exclaim, “ the spirit is on our side,” and having eaten the sheep and drunk the pottage with great joy and festivity, they return to their homes.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	Now I must mention a very great battle which was fought in the kingdom of Vociam, and you shall hear all how it happened.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	In the year of our Lord 1272, the great khan sent a mighty captain, named Nescardin, with 12,000 men, to defend the province of Caraian.

1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	Now the King of Mien and of Bangalat were afraid lest he should invade their territory ; yet they thought they were able to overcome and destroy the whole army in such a manner that the great khan might never feel inclined to send another into the same quarter.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	They assembled, therefore, 60,000 horse and foot, with 2000 elephants, each of which had on its back a castle well fortified and defended by twelve, fourteen, or sixteen men.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	The King of Mien came with the above army to the city of Vociam, where was the array of the Tartars, and took post in a plain at the distance of three days’ journey.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	Nescardin was somewhat alarmed, considering how small a force he had in comparison with the host of the King of Mien; but he took courage, reflecting that his troops were brave and most valiant warriors.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	He therefore marched to meet them in the plain of Vociam, and pitched his camp near a great forest, filled with lofty trees, into which he was aware that elephants could not enter.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	The King of Mien, seeing the army of Nescardin, advanced to attack it.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	The Tartars went with great boldness to meet them, but when their horses saw the elephants with the wooden castles upon them, stationed and arranged in the first line, they were struck with such terror that the riders could not, either by force or any contrivance, make them approach.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	They, therefore, immediately alighted, and tied them to the trees, when the infantry returned to the line of elephants, and began to discharge their arrows with the utmost violence.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	Those who were on the backs of the animals fought bravely; but the Tartars were stronger, and more accustomed to battle.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	They wounded very severely with these missiles a multitude of the elephants, which, being terrified, took to flight and rushed with violence into the adjacent wood.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	As they could not be restrained from entering, and rushing backward and forward through the thick trees in confusion, they broke the wooden castles on their backs, and destroyed all their equipments.

1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	They began the attack with a shower of arrows, but as the king and his troops still defended themselves valiantly, they drew their swords, and rushed into close combat.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	Now mighty blows were struck ; swords and spears were fiercely thrust on both sides ; heads, arms, and hands were struck off ; and many warriors fell to the earth dead and dying.

1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	At length, after midday, the host of Mien gave way; and the king, with all who survived the battle, took to flight, pursued by the Tartars, who killed many of the fugitives.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	When satisfied with pursuit, they returned to the wood to catch the elephants.
1	PART 1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	They endeavoured to stop the flight of these animals by cutting down the trees and laying them across; yet they are so intelligent, that the soldiers would not have succeeded but for the aid of some of the captives taken in battle, through whose means they were able to recover two hundred.

2	PART 1	29	Of the City of Samarcan	The believers of Samarcan rejoiced greatly at his conversion, and erected a large church in honour of it, bearing the name of St John the Baptist.
2	PART 1	29	Of the City of Samarcan	They took a large and fine stone belonging to the Saracens, and made it the base of a column, which rose in the middle of the edifice, and supported the whole roof.
2	PART 1	29	Of the City of Samarcan	Now it came to pass that Ciagatai died, whereupon the Mohammedans, having been much enraged at this stone being taken for the use of the church, consulted with each other how to recover it by force.
2	PART 1	29	Of the City of Samarcan	This they could now easily do, being ten to one of their adversaries, Several of their elders went and told the Christians that they wished to receive back the slab, which had been formerly theirs.
2	PART 1	29	Of the City of Samarcan	The latter answered, that they would willingly restore it, but for the injury it would do to their building, and offered to pay a fair price for it.
2	PART 1	29	Of the City of Samarcan	The others replied, that they wished neither gold nor treasure, but must have their stone.

2	PART 1	3	On Armenia the Greater	I assure you the province is very large, and during the summer all the Tartars of the Levant reside here with their flocks and herds, on account of its rich pastures ; but in winter they cannot remain because of the severe cold and snow, amid which the animals could not live.
2	PART 1	3	On Armenia the Greater	Now, in this Armenia is the ark of Noah on a great mountain.
2	PART 1	3	On Armenia the Greater	The circuit of its base cannot be traversed in less than two days ; and the ascent is rendered impracticable by the snow on its summit, which never dissolves, but is increased by each successive fall.

2	PART 1	3	On Armenia the Greater	It is not good for eating, but very fit for fuel, for anointing the camels in maladies of the skin, and for other purposes ; for which reason people come from a great distance for it, and nothing else is burned in all this country.
2	PART 1	3	On Armenia the Greater	Now let us quit Armenia, and tell of Georgia.

2	PART 1	32	Of the Province of Pein	Know that all the provinces now described from Cascar to the present, and still farther on, belong to Great Turkey.
2	PART 1	32	Of the Province of Pein	Now let us tell of a province named Ciarcian.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	Ciarcian is a province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east, with a capital city of the same name.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	The people adore Mohammed, and have a good number of towns and castles, There is a river bringing jasper and calcedony, which, being of excellent quality, they take to sell in Cathay, and thus make great profit.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	This province is sandy, as well as the whole road from Cotan hither ; and much of the water is bad and bitter, but in various places it is good.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	When an enemy passes through the country, they flee with their wives, children, and cattle, two or three days’ journey through the sand to places abounding in fine water and pasturage ; and no one can tell where they have gone, because the wind blowing the sand obliterates all traces of their march, and they thus escape the invader.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	But when a friendly army passes through, they send away only the beasts, because the troops would take and eat them, without any payment.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	After departing from Ciarcian, you go five days through the waste, finding the water bad and bitter, but occasionally sweet and good.
2	PART 1	33	Of the Province of Ciarcian	At the end of these five days you come to a city which lies at the commencement of the great desert, wherein provisions are laid in for its passage, and therefore I must tell you about it.

2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	You must know that those persons who wish to pass this tract rest in the city a week to refresh themselves and their cattle ; then, having taken a month’s provisions and provender, they enter upon the desert, which I assure you is so extensive that if a man were to travel through its whole length, it would employ a year ; and even at its smallest breadth, a month is requisite.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	t It consists altogether of mountains and valleys of sand, and nothing is got to eat; but after travelling a day and a night, you find sweet water sufficient for from fifty to a hundred men, with their animals.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	A larger body could not be supplied.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	Thus, water is seen daily, or altogether in about twenty-eight places, and except in three or four it is good.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	Beasts or birds there are none, because they could not find food; but there is agreat wonder which I must now tell you.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	When a party rides by night through this desert, and any one lags behind, or straggles from his companions through sleep or any other cause, when he seeks to return to them, he hears spirits speak to him in such a manner that they seem to be his comrades, and they frequently call him by name, and thus lead him out of his way so that he never regains it, and many persons are thus lost and perish.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	I must tell you, too, that even by day you hear these voices of spirits, and even tambours, and many other instruments sounding.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	They find it necessary, also, before going to rest at night, to fix an advanced signal, pointing out the course to be afterwards held ; likewise to attach a bell to each of the animals, that they may be more easily kept from straggling.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	In this manner, amid much danger and fear, this desert is passed.
2	PART 1	34	Of the City and Desert of Lop	Now we must tell you of the countries that lie on the other side.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	When you have rode thirty days through this desert, you find a city named Sacchion,which belongs to the khan, The province is called Tangut,and the people are idolaters, mixed with some Nestorian Christians and Saracens.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	The first have languages of their own ; they subsist not by merchandise, but by the grain which they produce from the earth.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	They have many abbeys and monasteries, all full of idols of various shapes, to which they offer frequent sacrifices and homage.

2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	They then take the meat and carry it to the house, or wherever they please, send for their relations, and eat it with great joy and respect.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	They afterwards collect the bones, and preserve them with much diligence.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	You must know likewise, that when any one of them dies, his body is burned, and after he is carried to the place for this last ceremony, they erect in the middle of the path a house of cane, covered with cloths of silk and gold.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	When the dead man is laid before this ornamented house, they place before him wine and victuals, believing that he will be similarly honoured in the other world.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	At the place of burning, too, they cut in paper, men, horses, camels, and coins of the size of bezarits, convinced that the deceased will possess all these things in the future state.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	On this occasion, all the instruments in the land are sounded before the corpse.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	I must tell you, too, that after death the relations send for the astrologer, who is informed of the day, month, and year of his nativity, and then divines, by his diabolical art, the day on which the burning ought to take place.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	If it should be a week, a month, or six months, they keep it all that time, and never burn it till the appointed day.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	During this interval, they deposit it in a large box covered with cloth, and so preserved with crocus and other spices that no stench arises.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	Throughout this period, they place daily before the box meat and drink, and leave it there for some time, till they think he has eaten it.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	These sorcerers, too, often tell the relations that the dead body must not be carried out by the main door, but by a private one, or even through a breach made in the wall.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	All the idolaters in the world proceed in this manner.
2	PART 1	35	Of the Province of Tangut and City of Sacchion	Now I must go to another city which lies to the south, near the extremity of this desert.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	Kamult is a province, formerly a kingdom, containing cities and castles, with a capital of the same name.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	It stands between two deserts, the great one already described, and a smaller one, extending three days’ journey.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	| The people are all idolaters, and have a peculiar language ; they live by the fruits of the earth, having enough to eat, and also to sell to the passenger.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	They are men of great gaiety, thinking of nothing but to sound musical instruments, to sing, dance, and delight their hearts, When a stranger comes to lodge in a house, the master is highly pleased, and leaves him with his wife, desiring her to treat him in every respect as a husband, while he himself goes and spends two or three days elsewhere.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	All the men of the province proceed in this manner, and do not account it any disgrace.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	The women are handsome, gay, and fond of diversion.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	Now, when Mangou Khan reigned as sire of the Tartars, it was reported to him how the people of Kamul gave over their wives to strangers, when he sent orders that, under a severe penalty, travellers should not be henceforth entertained in this manner.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	When they received this injunction, they were greatly grieved, held a council, and did what I will now tell you.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	They made up a large present, and sent it to Mangou, praying that he would allow them to treat their wives according to the custom handed down to them by their ancestors, who, for this kindness to strangers, had gained the favour of their idols, and their corn and other crops had greatly multiplied.
2	PART 1	36	Of the City of Kamul	When he heard this message, he said, “Since you are so bent on your own shame, let it be so”.

2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	There is also one from which is made the salamander; but do not suppose this is the animal so called, for no creature can live in fire, because it is compounded of the four elements.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	It is only through ignorance that the salamander is called an animal ; and a Turk, named Zurficar, who was very learned, and governor of this province for three years under the great khan, being much employed in working the mines, gave me an account of it.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	When this ore is taken from the mountain, and is broken, it strings together, and forms a thread like wool.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	Being then dried, pounded in a large mortar, and washed, there remains that thread of which I have spoken.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	Being then woven like wool, it forms cloth, which is dingy in colour at first, but when placed and left some time in the fire, it becomes white as snow, without dirt or stain.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	This is the truth of the salamander, and every thing else said about itis mere fable.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	I can tell you, too, that at Rome there is a cloth which the great khan sent to the pope as a costly present, and the sudarium of our Lord was placed within it.
2	PART 1	37	Of the Province of Ginghintalas	Now let us tell you of other provinces to the south-east and east.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	When you have departed from the province now described, you go ten days in the same direction.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	In all that way there are few habitations, nor does any thing occur worth mentioning.

2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	The people are Christians, and idolaters, and under the great khan.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	All the three provinces last described belong to the general one named Tangut.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	Through all its mountains, rhubarb is found in great abundance, and the merchants purchase and carry it over the whole world.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	t They cannot, however, take this road through the mountains with any animals but those accustomed to the country, because a poisonous plant grows there, which, when eaten, causes the hoofs to drop off ; but the native cattle, having learned its dangerous quality, carefully avoid it.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	t They live by the fruits of the earth, but attend little to merchandise.
2	PART 1	38	Of the Province of Succiur	Now I must tell you of another city.

2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	Their priests live more respectably than others, and guard themselves against luxury, though they do not hold it for a very great sin.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	They observe the lunar months like ours, and in one of them do not kill any beast or bird.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	For five days they eat no food that has had life, and live more strictly than usual.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	They take sometimes thirty wives, or as many as they have wealth to maintain, and give them a dowry in beasts, slaves, and money ; but the first wife ranks always as the principal.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	If any of them do not please him, she may be divorced.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	They marry their cousins and even the wives of their father, and do not regard as sins many things which we account great ones ; for they live like beasts : therefore let us leave them and go to the north.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	But I must tell you that Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco, remained in that city a year, on particular business which I need not enter into.
2	PART 1	39	Of the Province of Canpicion	We shall now go sixty days northwards.

2	PART 1	4	On Georgia and its Productions	This is the province which Alexander could not pass through on account of the narrowness of the path ; because on one side is the sea, and on the other very high mountains, over which it is impossible to ride ; and, as this strait continues above four leagues, a few men might hold out against the whole world.
2	PART 1	4	On Georgia and its Productions	This was the reason why he could not pass; but he built a very strong tower, that no one might come upon him from the other side, and it is called the Iron Gate.

2	PART 1	41	Of the City of Karakorum	Karakorum isa city three miles in circuit,which was the first that the Tartars took when they issued from their country, and I am to tell you of their actions and manners, how they gained command, and spread themselves over the world.
2	PART 1	41	Of the City of Karakorum	You must know that they dwelt in the north, about Ciorcia, in which region are great plains, and no abode in cities or castles, but good pasturage, large rivers, and abundance of water.
2	PART 1	41	Of the City of Karakorum	They had no lords, yet paid tribute to the great sire, named in their language Unchan, whom we call Prester John, and who is spoken of over all the world.
2	PART 1	41	Of the City of Karakorum	They paid to him one beast out of every ten; but they multiplied so greatly, that he became afraid of them, and resolved to separate them into different countries; for which purpose he sent his barons among them.

2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	He was a man of great worth, sense, and prowess; and let me tell you, when he was elected, all the Tartars in the world that were scattered through those strange countries came and owned him as their lord.
2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	He maintained his power with great vigour, and the multitudes who ranged under his standard were almost innumerable.
2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	When he saw so numerous an army, he went conquering other countries, and made himself master of eight provinces ; yet he neither injured nor robbed the people of any thing, but placing them under leaders in whom he could confide, led them on to other triumphs.

2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	heard, a multitude of nations ; and seeing his good command and mildness, they cheerfully followed him, upon which he formed the design of subduing a great part of the world.
2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	In the year 1200, he sent a message to Prester John, asking his daughter to wife.
2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	"Hereupon that monarch was very indignant, and said,—""What impudence is this in Gengis Khan!"

2	PART 1	42	On Gengis, the first Khan of the Tartare	They presently went away, and coming to their master, told him in order all that the other had said.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	When Gengis Khan heard this boastful speech, his heart swelled, so that it almost burst within him ; for you must know he was a man of very great pride.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	He then said to his minister, and to all about him, that he would not continue to hold the sovereignty, unless Prester John were made to pay more dearly for this villany than ever man did, and he must soon be made to see whether he was his vassal.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	Then he summoned round him the greatest army that ever was seen or heard of, and sent notice to Unchan that he must defend himself, as he was coming against him.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	When that prince knew certainly the approach of Gengis with so great a force, he made light of it, saying, they were not men-at-arms ; yet.

2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	And why make a long story!
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	The khan, with all his people, came to a great and beautiful plain, named Tenduc, in Prester John’s country, where he pitched his camp, and rejoiced greatly to hear that his enemy was coming, because it was an excellent situation for giving battle.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	He sent for his astrologers, who were Christian and Saracen, and required to know which would conquer in that battle, he or his antagonist.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	The latter could tell nothing of the truth ; but the former showed it openly; for they brought before him a cane, cut in the middle, and placed the two parts on different sides, and wrote the name of Gengis on one, and of Unchan on the other, telling him, that when they had made their enchantment, he whose cane should come above that of the other would conquer in battle.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	He desired that this should be shown to him as soon as possible.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	Then they took up the Psaltery, read certain portions, and performed their enchantment, when presently the cane on which was the name of Gengis, without any one touching it, joined the other, and mounted above it, and this was witnessed by all present.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	When he saw this, he was greatly rejoiced, and seeing that the Christians were men of truth, held them always in great honour.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	Two days after, the armies engaged, and it was the greatest battle that ever was fought.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	The slaughter was terrible on both sides; but at length Gengis conquered, his enemy was slain in the engagement, and he himself became master of all his land.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	From that day he went on conquering many castles and provinces, and reigned six years ; but, at the end of that time, he besieged a fort, named Cangui, where he was wounded in the knee by an arrow, and died.
2	PART 1	43	His Battle with Prester John, and Victory over him	This was a great misfortune, for he was a brave and wise man.
2	PART 1	44	On the Khans who reigned after the Death of Gengis	After the death of Gengis, the next khan was Cui, the third Bacui, the fourth Alton, the fifth Mangou, the sixth Kublai,who is greater and more powerful than all the rest; for the other five together had not so much power as this Kublai ; nay, let me tell you, that all the emperors in the world, and all the Christian and Saracen kings, do not equal him, as is shown fully in our book.
2	PART 1	44	On the Khans who reigned after the Death of Gengis	Now you must know that the great lords of the lineage of Gengis Khan are buried in a lofty mountain called Altai, and whenever the chief lords of the Tartars die, if it should be a hundred days’ journey distant, they must be conveyed thither to be interred.
2	PART 1	44	On the Khans who reigned after the Death of Gengis	I will tell you another striking wonder ; that when the bodies of the khans are carried to these mountains, the conductors put to the sword all the men whom they meet on the road, saying, “ Go and serve the great lord in the other world ;” and they do the same to the horses, killing also for that purpose the best he has, You must know that when Mangou died, more than 20,000 men were slain, who had been met on the road when his body was removed to be buried.

2	PART 1	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	When they go to battle with their enemies, they conquer in this manner: they apparently betake themselves to a shameful flight, for they have so trained their horses that they turn round and round like dogs.
2	PART 1	46	On their Wars, and the Order of their Armies	And when they are fleeing and hotly pursued, they fight as well as when they face the enemy ; for in their swiftest flight they wheel about and discharge their arrows, which kill both men and horses of the opposite army, who, when they think their adversaries discomfited and vanquished, fall themselves one after the other.

2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	And know, assuredly, that the caliph was found to possess the most abundant treasure in gold, silver, and precious stones that ever was in the possession of man ; and I will tell you how it happened.
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	In the year of our Lord, 1255,the great sire of the Tartars, who is named Alau,brother to the great sire that now reigns, assembled a very large army, and marched upon Baldach and took it by force, which was a glorious exploit ; for it contained more than 100,000 horsemen besides foot soldiers ;and when it was taken, he found the caliph in possession of a tower full of gold, silver, and other treasure, such as never was seen at once in one place.
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	When he discovered it he sent for the monarch and said : “Caliph, why have you amassed such a treasure, and what do you mean todo with it?
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	Did you not know that I was your enemy, and coming to attack you with this mighty host!
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	Knowing this, why did you not take your treasure, and give it to knights and soldiers to defend you and your city?
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	” The caliph replied nothing, because he knew not what to say.
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	Then, said Alau: “Caliph, since I see you love so much your treasure, I will give it you to eat”.
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	He then commanded that he should be shut up in the tower with the treasure, and that nothing should be given to him to eat or drink.
2	PART 1	6	On Baldach	Then he said to him: “ Caliph, eat your treasure as heartily as you please, for you will never eat any thing else”.

2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Now I am to tell you of a great miracle which happened between Baldach and Mosul in the year 1225.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	There was a caliph in the former who held the Christians in great hatred, as it is natural for all the Saracens in the world to do, He thought day and night how he might compel all those in his country to become converts, or else kill them.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Many others concurred in that wicked purpose, and they agreed upon this plan : They found in the gospel a text saying that if a Christian had as much faith as a grain of mustard-seed and made his prayer to God, he would be able to join two mountains together.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	On finding this text, they felt great joy, thinking they had thus either a means of converting them, or a pretext for killing them outright.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	He therefore sent for all the Jacobite and Nestorian believers in his country, who were very numerous; and when they came before him, he showed them this gospel, made them read it, and asked if it were true.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	They replied that it was so.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Then, continued the caliph, since so many Christians are here, there surely must be among you this small measure of faith ; therefore, said he, pointing to a large hill in view, you must remove that mountain, or I will put you allto death, because otherwise you must be wholly destitute of faith, and on that account deserve to die.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	If, however, you will turn to our good law of Mohammed, you shall be forgiven; and, in the mean time, I allow you tefi days to do what is required.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	He then dismissed them.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	On hearing what the caliph had said, they were in great fear, and knew not what to resolve.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Then they all assembled, small and great, men and women, the bishop, archbishop, and priests of whom there were a considerable number, and they remained eight days and eight nights in prayer, that God, in his mercy, and for the diffusion of his faith, would come to their aid, and enable them to escape this cruel death with which they were threatened.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	But what have I now to tell you!
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	While they were thus deeply engaged in prayer, an angel, by the message of God, appeared to a bishop who was a man of very holy life.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	He said, “Oh, bishop!
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	do you now go to acertain shoemaker with one eye, and tell him that at his prayer the mountain will be moved”.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Now this shoemaker was a very honest and chaste man ; he fasted and went regularly to mass, and ‘gave every day bread to the poor.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	I will tell you a thing that he did, to prove his good faith and life.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	It happened one day that a very beautiful woman came to his shop to purchase a pair of shoes, and in order to make them fit, he was obliged to look at her foot and ankle, and they were so finely shaped that he felt his eye take an undue pleasure in viewing them.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	As soon as she was gone, he began bitterly to reproach himself, and remembered the text, “if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee”.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	He then took a sharp weapon, and stuck it into his eye, so that it burst in his head, and he never saw with it again.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Thus you see he was a most holy and good man.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	When, therefore, the bishop had this vision, he told it to all his people, and they agreed that this shoemaker should be called before them, and when he came, they requested him to pray to God that he would make the mountain move.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	But when the shoemaker heard what the bishop and the others said, he answered that he was not so good a man as that God or our lady should for his sake do so great a miracle.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	But the Christians pressed him so earnestly, that he at last agreed, and made the prayer.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	When the final day was come, they all rose early in the morning, great and small, male and female; and entering the church, they sung the holy mass, and then proceeded out to the plain in front of the mountain.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	They were fully a hundred thousand, and they all placed themselves in front of the cross.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	The caliph then came with a vast number of Saracens, eager to slay the unbelievers, for they thought it impossible the hill could be moved, and they themselves were in great fear and doubt ; nevertheless they had good hope in their Creator.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Then the shoemaker fell on his knees before the cross, lifted his hands to heaven, and prayed fervently that the mountain might be moved, and the Christians there assembled escape a dreadful death.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	When he had made his prayer, it was not long before the vast eminence began to stir, and move from its place.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	The Saracens, on seeing this, wondered greatly, and many of them were converted ; nay, the caliph himself became a believer in the gospel, but secretly, and when he died, a cross was found round his neck; for which reason he was not buried in the same place with the other sovereigns, but in a tomb by himself.
2	PART 1	8	On a certain Miracle of the Movement of a Mountain in that Region	Now let us leave Baldach and go to Persia.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	Persia isa very extensive province, anciently very rich and flourishing, but now in a great degree wasted and destroyed by the Tartars.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	It contains a city called Sava, whence the three magi came to adore Jesus Christ when born at Bethlehem.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	In that city are buried the three, in separate tombs, above which is a square house carefully preserved.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	Their hearts are still entire, with their hair and beards.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	One was named Balthazar, the other Gaspar, the third Melchior.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	Messer Marco inquired often in that city about these three magi, but no one could tell him any thing, except that they were ancient kings, who were there buried.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They informed him, however, that three days’ journey farther was a tower called the Castle of the Fire-worshippers, because the men there venerate fire, and for the following reason.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They say that anciently three kings of that country went to adore acertain prophet, newly born, and carried three offerings, gold, incense, and myrrh, to know if he were a king, a god, or a sage; for they said that, if he took gold, he was aking; if incense, he wasa god; if myrrh, he was a sage.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They went in one after another, and though they were of different ages and fashions, he appeared to each of them exactly like himself.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	When they came out and compared what they had seen, they wondered much, and then went in altogether, and the child then appeared to them what he really was, a boy of thirteen days old.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They presented to him the three offerings, and he took them all, whence they concluded that he was at once god, king, and sage.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	He presented to them a closed box, desiring them not to open it till their return home.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	After having travelled a number of days, however, they were curious to see what was in the box, and opened it, when they found only a stone, which was meant to express that they should remain firm in the faith which they had received.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They did not understand this meaning, and despising the gift, threw it into a well, when immediately a great fire came down from heaven, and began to burn brightly.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	When they saw this wonder, they were quite astonished, and repented that they had thrown.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	away the stone.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They however took a portion of the fire, carried it to their country, and placed it in their church, where they kept it continually burning.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	They revere it as a god, and use it for burning all their sacrifices ; and when at any time it goes out, they repair to that well, where the fire is never extinguished,and from it bring a fresh supply.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	This is what all the people of that country tell, and Messer Marco was assured of it by those of the castle, and therefore it is truth.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	One of these kings was of Saba, the other of Ava, the other of the castle.
2	PART 1	9	On the Province of Persia, and the Journey of the Magi	Now let me tell you of Persia, its cities, and the actions and customs of the people.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	Havine described so many inland provinces, I will now enter upon India, with the wonderful objects in that region.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	The ships in which the merchants navigate thither are made of fir, with only one deck, but many of them are divided beneath into sixty compartments, in each of which a person can be conveniently accommodated.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	They have one rudder and four masts ; while some have two additional, which can be put up and taken down at pleasure.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	Many of the largest have besides as many as thirteen divisions in the hold, formed of thick planks mortised into each other.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	The object is to guard against accidents which may cause the vessel to spring a leak, such as striking on a rock or being attacked by a whale, This last circumstance is not unusual ; for dur-  ing the night the motion of the ship through the waves  raises a foam that invites the hungry animal, which,  hoping to find food, rushes violently against the hull,  and often forces in part of the bottom.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	The water,  entering by the leak, runs on to the well, which is al-  ways kept clear ; and the crew, on perceiving the occur-  rence, remove the goods from the inundated division, and  the boards are so tight that it cannot pass to any other.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	They then repair the injury and replace the articles.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	The  plaiJ^ are double, fastened with iron nails, and plastered  without and within, but not secured by pitch, of which  the people are destitute.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	They therefore take lime, beat  it into fine powder, and mix it with an oil from trees, so  that it becomes equal to glue.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	These vessels carry two  hundred mariners, and five or six thousand loads of  pepper ; they are moved by oars, on each of which four  hands are employed.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	Every one of them has two barks,  large enough to carry a thousand loads, and forty seamen  well armed, who often assist in dragging the large ships.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	Ten small boats are also kept for fishing and various other services ; two being attached to each bark.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	‘When the ships have sailed a year, and stand in need of repair, a fresh plank is fastened above the two others, then nailed and cemented, till they sometimes acquire a depth of six planks.
3	PART 1	1	India and the Ships navigating thither	Having thus described the merchant-vessels that go to India, I will tell you of the country itself ; but first I must mention the many isles in this sea lying to the eastward ; and first, of one named Zipangu.
3	PART 1	10	Kingdom of Ferlech	In that of Ferlech are Saracen merchants, who come with their vessels, and have converted the people to the law of Mohammed ; but only in the city, for those in the mountains live like brutes, eating the flesh of men and of the vilest animals.
3	PART 1	10	Kingdom of Ferlech	They worship various objects, particularly the first thing they meet after rising in the morning.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	Leaving Ferlech, you enter Basman,a kingdom by itself, whose people have a language of their own, and live without law, like beasts.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	They own the supremacy of the khan, but pay him no tribute, because the great distance prevents his troops from reaching them; yet they sometimes make him a present of strange objects.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	Here are wild elephants, and unicorns not much smaller, being double the size of a buffalo.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	They have a large black horn in the middle of the forehead, and beneath the tongue sharp prickles, which can inflict severe wounds, Their heads resemble that of the wild boar, yet they carry them bent to the earth.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	They are very ugly, and fond of wallowing among mire.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	It is not true, as asserted among us, that they allow themselves to be taken by a virgin, but quite the contrary.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	There are here good and serviceable falcons, black like crows ; also a prodigious number of monkeys of various forms and habits.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	But you must know that those who bring the little men from India practise a great deception.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	I assure you the figures to which they give that name are manufactured in this island in the following manner :— There is a species of small monkey, with a face resembling the human, which they catch, skin, and shave off all the hair except on the beard and chin; having then moulded them intoa human semblance, they dryand preservethem with camphor and other articles.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	But it is a gross deception ; for neither in India, nor in any other country, however savage, are there men so small as these pretended ones.
3	PART 1	11	Kingdom of Basman	t Now let us tell of a kingdom called Samara.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	When a man departs from Basman, he finds the kingdom of Samara, in which I myself, Marco Polo, remained five months, because the bad weather did not allow us to sail, Here neither the north star nor the constellation of the Greater Bear appeared.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	The people are savage idolaters, governed by a rich and powerful king, and owning a nominal submission to the great khan.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	During our stay, we landed and erected castles of wood and twigs, where we remained through the fear of these wicked men, who eat their fellow-creatures.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	The best fishes in the world are found here.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	The people have no wheat, living on rice ; and they make no wine.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	You must know there is a kind of tree, of which they cut a branch, and place a pot beneath, when, during the night, the vessel is filled, and very good wine is thus produced, both red and white.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	The tree resembles a small date-palm, with four branches, and when it ceases to give out more wine, they water its root, which causes it to produce again.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	* They have great quantities of very large Indian nuts, and eat all kinds of flesh, good and bad.
3	PART 1	12	Kingdom of Samara	Now let us tell you of a kingdom which is named Dagroian.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	This kingdom has a language of its own; the people are very savage, subject to a king, but owning the supremacy of the great khan.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	They are savage idolaters, and have the following very bad custom :—When a man falls sick, his relations send for the magicians, and inquire if he will recover, as these deceivers profess to know, by their enchantments and idols, whether he will live or die.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	Inthe latter case, the friends send for persons who place something over hismouth, by which he is suffocated.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	They then cook the body, and all the kinsmen come and eat his flesh, taking care not to leave the smallest portion; which they believe would breed worms, and thus seriously afflict the soul of the deceased.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	They next collect the bones, and place them in a large and beautiful chest, which they carry to caverns in the mountains, beyond the reach of wild beasts or any other injury.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	When they take any man belonging to another country, who cannot redeem himself, they kill and eat him in like manner.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	This is a very bad practice.
3	PART 1	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	I must now, however, tell you something of Lambri.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	Lambri is a kingdom having a sovereign of its own, who owns the supremacy of the khan.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	The people are all idolaters ; they have a great abundance of camphor and other spices ; likewise brazil-wood.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	This they sow, and when it has grown to a little twig, they transplant it to another place, and at the end of three years root it up.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	We brought some of this seed to Venice, but it did not spring at all on account of the cold.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	I will tell you another very wonderful thing ; for there are men in this kingdom who have tails like dogs, larger than a palm, and who are covered with hair.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	They remain in the mountains, never visiting the towns.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	* There are unicorns, with various beasts and birds for hunting.
3	PART 1	14	Kingdom of Lambri	Now let us depart and tell you of Fansur.
3	PART 1	15	Kingdom of Fansur	The people of Fansur are idolaters, have a king, and nominally acknowledge the great khan.
3	PART 1	15	Kingdom of Fansur	Here grows the best canfara fansuri, which is much more valued than any other ; indeed it sells for its weight in gold.
3	PART 1	15	Kingdom of Fansur	Wine is drawn from trees, in the manner described above : another wonder is, that, in this province, meal is obtained from them.

3	PART 1	17	Island of Seilan	It is 2400 miles in circuit ; yet I must tell you that anciently it was larger, being 3600, as appears by the old maps of the mariners on that sea ; but the north wind blows with such violence, that a great part has been carried away by the water.

3	PART 1	17	Island of Seilan	I will now describe the most precious thing in the world; for here are noble and beautiful rubies, which can be procured nowhere else ; also the sapphire, the topaz, the amethyst, and various other precious stones.

3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	Some time after, he saw one unable to walk, and with all his teeth decayed through extreme old age.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	Having asked, and being informed what that was, he declared he would no longer remain in this evil region, but would seek a place where men neither died nor grew old.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	He left the palace, and journeyed into great and trackless mountains, where he spent his whole life virtuously and chastely, observing rigid abstinence ; so that had he been a Christian, he must have been a very great saint.

3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	All the people of the country adored him as a god, and they say that he died eighty-four times, becoming first an ox, then a horse, then a dog, and various other animals ; but that the eighty-fourth time he became a god, and they worship him as their best and greatest.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	These were the first idolaters, from whom all the others in Seilan were descended.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	But I assure you, many from the most distant countries come hither on pilgrimage, as Christians to the shrine of St James, and the monument on this mountain is said to be that of the prince, whose teeth, hair, and skull were preserved.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	But the Saracens say that it is that of Adam, our first parent.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	God knows which is right, but one cannot believe the latter, for the Scriptures of our holy church assure us that he died in another part of the world.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	Now it happened that the great khan, hearing that the tomb of Adam, with the other objects mentioned, was on this mountain, sent, in 1284, a numerous embassy, who travelled by land to the island of Seilan.

3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	I assure you, too, they found this cup to be of such virtue, that when food was introduced for one man, there would be enough for five ; and the great khan declared he had tried this, and found it the truth.
3	PART 1	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	Now having told you truly all this history, I will leave it and relate other things.

3	PART 1	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	They gave a tenth to the king, and a twentieth to the Abraiamain, who enchants the fishes, depriving them of the power to injure the persons who dive under water for the pearls ; indeed he can enchant also all kinds of beasts and birds.

3	PART 1	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	When the men in the boats have found water four to twelve feet deep, they plunge to the bottom, and get shells called sea-oysters, and within whose flesh are found pearls of all sizes and shapes.
3	PART 1	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	These are brought up in very large quantities, and distributed over the world,—the king drawing from them a great revenue.
3	PART 1	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	During the rest of the year they are not found here; but at a place 300 miles distant, where they are taken from September to the middle of October.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	This is a very large island, fifteen hundred miles from the continent.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The people are fair, handsome, and of agreeable manners.

3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	Gold is very abundant, and no man being allowed to export it, while no merchant goes thence to the mainland, the people accumulate a vast amount.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	But I will give you a wonderful account of a very large palace, all covered with that metal, as our churches are with lead.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The pavement of the chamber, the halls, windows, and every other part, have it laid on two inches thick,so that the riches of this palace are incalculable.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	Here are also red pearls, large, and of equal value with the white, with many other precious stones.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	* Kublai, on hearing of this amazing wealth, desired to conquer the island, and sent two of his barons with a very large fleet containing warriors, both horsemen and on foot.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	One was named Abatan, the other Vonsanicin, both wise and valiant.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	They sailed from Zai-tun and Kin-sai, reached the isle, landed, and took possession of the plain and of a number of houses ; but they had been unable to take any city or castle, when a sad misadventure occurred.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	A mutual jealousy arose amongst them, which prevented their acting in any concert.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	One day when the north wind blew very strong, the troops expressed to each other apprehensions, that if they remained, all the vessels would be wrecked.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The whole then went on board and set sail.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	When they had proceeded about four miles, they found another small isle, on which, the storm being violent, a number sought refuge.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	Others could not reach it, many of whom suffered shipwreck and perished ; but some were preserved and sailed for their native country.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	Those who had landed, 30,000 in number, looked on themselves as dead men, seeing no means of ever escaping ; and their anger and grief were increased, when they beheld the other ships making their way homeward.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The sovereign and people of the large isle rejoiced greatly when they saw the host thus scattered and many of them cast upon the islet.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	As soon as the sea calmed, they assembled a great number of ships, sailed thither and landed, hoping to capture all those refugees.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	But when the latter saw that their enemies had disembarked, leaving the vessels unguarded, they skilfully retreated to another quarter, and continued moving about till they reached the ships, and went on board without any opposition.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	They then sailed direct for the principal island, hoisting its own standards and ensigns.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	On seeing these, the people believed their own countrymen had returned, and allowed them to enter the city.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The Tartars, finding it defended only by old men, soon drove them out, retaining the women as slaves.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	When the king and his warriors saw themselves thus deceived, and their city captured, they were like to die of grief; but they assembled other ships, and invested it so closely as to prevent all communication.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The invaders maintained it seven months, and planned day and night how they might convey tidings to their master of their present condition ; but finding this impossible, they agreed with the besiegers to surrender, securing only their lives.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	This took place in the year 1269.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	The great khan, however, ordered one of the commanders of this host to lose his head, and the other to be sent to the isle where he had caused the loss of so many men, and there put todeath.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	I have to relate also a very wonderful thing, that these two barons took a number of persons ina castle of Zipangu, and because they had refusedto surrender, ordered all their heads to be cut off ; but there were eight on whom they could not execute this sentence, because these wore consecrated stones in the arm between the skin and the flesh, which so enchanted them, that they could not die by steel.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	They were therefore beaten to death with clubs, and the stones, being extracted, were held very precious.
3	PART 1	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	But I must leave this matter and go on with the narrative.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	Now, in all this province of Maabar, there is not a tailor, for the people go naked at every season.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	The air is always so temperate, that they wear only a piece of cloth round the middle.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	‘The king is dressed just like the others, except that his cloth is finer,t and he wears a necklace full set with rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and other precious stones, worth a great treasure.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	He has also suspended from his neck a silken cord, reaching a pace down, and containing 104 of the largest pearls and most valuable rubies.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	It is worn because he repeats every day, morning and evening, 104 prayers in honour of his idols.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	To this he is bound by his faith and religion, by the example and injunction of his ancestors.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	He wears also round three parts both of his arms and legs, bracelets of gold, full of goodly stones and pearls.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	In short, the number of his jewels is surprising, being of more value than a handsome city, and no wonder, since they are all produced in his own dominions.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	No man is allowed to export either a pearl or stone of great value, but must produce it to him, and as he gives double its cost, they do so very willingly, whence he has collected so ample a store.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	Now I must tell you of other marvellous things: he has 500 wives ; and as soon as he sees a beautiful lady, takes and keeps her for himself.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	He did the same in the case of a very handsome wife of his brother, who, being a prudent man, submitted, and did not quarrel on that account.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	The king has certain faithful adherents, who attend him on horseback wherever he goes, and hold great commands under him ; nay, what is wonderful, they serve him both in this and in the other world.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	‘Whenever he dies, and his body is thrown into a great fire, these vassals throw themselves after him, that they may accompany and serve him still in the future state.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	It is the national custom that, when the king dies, and leaves a great treasure, his son will not spend it for the world; saying, I have all my father’s kingdom and people, why should I not support myself as he did.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	Thus the treasure collected in this kingdom becomes immense.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	In this country no horses are reared, and hence the greater part of the revenue is employed in obtaining them from foreign regions.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	The merchants of Curmos, of Quisci, of Dufar, of Soer, and of Aden, whose provinces contain many steeds of fine quality, purchase, embark, and bring them to the king and his four princely brothers, selling them for 500 sagi of gold, worth more than 100 mares of silver.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	I assure you, this monarch buys annually more than 2000, but, by the end of the year, they are all dead, from wanting the medicine necessary to keep them in health.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	The merchants who import them wish this to happen, and are therefore careful not to introduce the cure.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	Another custom is, that when a man has committed a crime, and is condemned to die, he expresses a wish to devote himself in honour of a certain divinity, to which the king consents.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	Then his relations and friends place him on a wagon, giving him twelve knives, and lead him through the city, calling out, “ This brave man is about to kill himself for the love of the great idol”.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	When they come to the place of execution, he takes a knife and cries aloud, “ I kill myself for the love of such a deity”.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	He then, with different knives, strikes himself in one arm, then in the other, next in the stomach, and so on till he expires, when the relations burn his body with great joy.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	I must tell you another custom of this country, that when a man is dead, and his body burned, his wife throws herself into the fire with her lord ; she is then much praised by the people, and many ladies follow the example.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	The men also of this kingdom adore idols, and many worship the ox, saying, he is a valuable animal, and on no account would they kill him, or eat his flesh.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	Yet there is a race named gaui who eat it, butas they dare not slay the animal, they use only those that die a natural or accidental death.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	All the people, too, anoint their houses with its dung.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	It is the custom also that the king, barons, and other persons sit upon the ground, and when asked why they decline a more honourable seat, they say, “ We came from earth, and must return to it, and cannot too much honour this common mother”.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	These gaui who eat beef are the persons by whose ancestors St Thomas the apostle was killed; hence none of this lineage can enter the place where he lies buried, nor could twenty men force them in, nor ten hold them there, on account of the virtue of that sacred body.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	In this country there grows no grain but rice.
3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	It is remarkable that large fine horses in process of breeding produce only ponies with twisted legs, unfit for riding, and good for nothing.

3	PART 1	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	They regard augury beyond any people in the world ; for, I assure you, if a man sets out on a journey, and meets an omen deemed unlucky, he often turns back.

3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	There is also an extensive and deep valley, so enclosed by rocks as to be quite inaccessible; but the people throw in pieces of flesh, to which the diamonds adhere.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	Now you must observe, there are a number of white eagles, which, when they see the flesh in the bottom of the valley, fly thither, seize and carry it to different spots.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	The men are on the watch, and as soon as they see the bird with the spoil in its mouth, raise loud cries, when, being terrified, it flies away and drops the meat, which they take up, and find the diamond attached.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	Even when the prey has been swallowed, they watch where the excrement is voided, and obtain in this way not a few jewels.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	Now this is the only country in the world containing these precious stones ; and do not suppose that the best come to our christian countries ; they are carried to the great khan and other lords of those regions, whose ample treasure enables them to purchase.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	I must mention, too, that here are made the most beautiful and valuable cotton cloths in the world ; also the thinnest and most delicate, resembling our spiders’ webs.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	They have abundance of animals, and the largest sheep in the world, with plentiful subsistence ofeverykind.
3	PART 1	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	I must now describe the place containing the body of the apostle St Thomas.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	This is in a small town of Maabar, containing few inhabitants, and seldom visited by merchants, there being little trade, and the roads difficult.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	Many Christians and Saracens, however, resort thither in pilgrimage: the latter esteem him a great saint, and even assert that he wasa Mohammedan.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	But I will now relate awonder.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	The Christians, who repair to that shrine, take from the place a red earth, carry it into their country, and give a small portion to any person sick of a fever, who is presently cured.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	But I have now a miracle to tell ; for about the year 1288, a baron of this district had a great quantity of rice, and filled with it all the houses around the church.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	The pilgrims having thus no place to lodge, prayed him much to desist ; but being fierce and proud, he paid no regard to their entreaty.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	Next night, accordingly, Messer St Thomas appeared to him with a fork in his hand, which he thrust forcibly against his throat, causing severe pain, and saying, “ If you do not forthwith empty my houses, you shall die an evil death”.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	He disappeared, and the baron rose early in the morning, related the apparition, and caused all the buildings to be emptied.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	The Christians greatly rejoiced, and honoured this great apostle.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	I could relate other wonderful cures effected on persons labouring under various bodily infirmities; but I will now merely describe his death.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	He had left his hermitage in the wood, and was engaged in prayer, while around were a number of peacocks, which are more numerous here than elsewhere in the world.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	Now an idolatrous Gaui, aiming at one of these birds, let fly an arrow without seeing the saint, whom, however, it struck on the right side ; and finding himself thus wounded, he very mildly adored his Creator, and soon after expired.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	But before coming hither, he had converted many people in Nubia,as I will afterwards narrate.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	When a child in this province is born, they anoint him every day with the oil of sesamé, which makes him become blacker than at birth; for whoever ix most deeply tinted is honoured in proportion.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	Indeed, these people paint their god and all their idols black, and their devils white as snow.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	The men, when they go to battle, place such faith in the ox as a holy thing, that they take the hair of the wild bull, and if they fight on a horse, attach it to the neck ; if on foot, to their shield ; thinking themselves thus better secured against every danger.
3	PART 1	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	Hence, the hair of this animal sells at a considerable price.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Lar is a province lying westward of this place, and thence came originally all the Abraiamain in the world.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	These are the best and most honest of all merchants, and would not on any account tell a lie.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They neither eat flesh nor drink wine, are faithful to their wives, and lead every way very virtuous lives.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They take nothing from any one, and do nothing that could be considered a sin.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They are all known by a silk thread worn over the shoulder, and tied beneath the opposite arm, so that it passes across both the breast and back.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	t They have arich king, who readily purchases precious stones, and enjoins that the merchants shall offer to him all the pearls brought from Maabar, for which he pays double the cost.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They therefore procure them in large quantities.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Theyare idolaters,and regard omens from birds and beasts more than any other nation in the world.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	I will tell you one of their customs: when one wishes to treat for any merchandise, he rises and observes his shadow in the sun ; and if it be of the due length, on that day, according to certain rules, he makes his bargain ; but if it be not long enough, he will not buy a single article.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	If they go to a house for this purpose, and see one of the animals named tarantula, which here greatly abound, they observe if it comes to them from a lucky quarter, in which case they buy ; but if otherwise, they give up the transaction and go away.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Nay, I assure you, if one leaving his house hears a man sneeze in a manner that does not appear lucky, he stops and re-enters, Even if on his road he sees a swallow approaching from the right or left, in an unlucky manner, he returns.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Their teeth are very good, through the use of an herb, which makes them look extremely well, and is very salutary.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They never bleed from the vein or any other part, yet perfectly preserve their health.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	There are among them an order named cuigui, who live to an extraordinary age, even 150 or 200 years, yet can perform all the service of the monastery and idols as well as younger men.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	This is owing to their great abstinence in eating and drinking ; for they subsist mostly on rice and milk.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They mingle also quicksilver and sulphur, making a beverage which they drink from their infancy, saying that it lengthens their lives.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	t There is also in this kingdom a religious order of more rigid cuigui, observing the strictest abstinence, leading a very rude and severe life, and going perfectly naked.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They adore the ox, and many wear on their forehead a small effigy of one in copper or bronze gilded.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They also burn the dung, and reduce it to a powder, with which they reverentially anoint many parts of their body, as Christians use holy water.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They eat neither from spoon nor platter, but from large leaves, mostly of the apple of paradise.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Even these must be dry ; for if green, they are said to have a soul, which it would be sin to kill; and they would rather die than commit towards any animal an action believed unlawful.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	When asked why they feel no shame in going naked, they say, because they wish to have nothing belonging to this world, which they entered without clothing ; and committing no sin, they have no reason to be ashamed.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Besides, they kill no living creature, neither fly nor flea, nor hog nor worm, considering they have souls.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They will sleep on the earth without any covering, whence it is a great wonder they do not die, much more that they enjoy so long a life.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	They fast the whole year round, drinking only water.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Some reside in the monastery to serve the gods; but before admission they undergo the following trial.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	The young girls offered to the idols caress these new candidates, and endeavour variously to entertain them.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Such as appear to take any pleasure in these endearments, are rejected as unworthy ; but if they show themselves totally indifferent, they are then retained.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	Such are the customs of these cruel and perfidious idolaters, who burn the bodies of their dead, because otherwise they would breed worms, which after eating the flesh would starve, and thus involve in great sin the soul to which the body belonged.
3	PART 1	23	Lar ; the Bramins	But I willnow cease saying any more about them.

3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	Often, when they will not yield to her prayer, and are about to engage, she takes a knife and says, “ If you will not renounce this quarrel, I will kill myself presently, and cut away the paps with which I gave you milk”.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	When the sons see this great piety in their mother, they feel themselves bound to make peace.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	But as soon as she is dead, they cannot fail to quarrel and destroy each other.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	All the natives here, as well as generally throughout India, have continually in their mouths the leaf called tembul.

3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	When any one wishes to insult another in the grossest manner, he spits this juice in his face.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	The injured party then hastens to the king, and declares his wish to decide the quarrel by combat.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	His majesty furnishes him with a sword and small shield ; and all the people assemble as spectators of the conflict, which is only terminated by the death of one of the parties.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	They are not, however, allowed to strike with the point of the sword.
3	PART 1	24	City of Cail	Now let us depart and tell you of the kingdom of Coilon.

3	PART 1	25	Kingdom of Coilon	Being then placed in the hot sun, it boils, acquires consistence, and becomes what we see.
3	PART 1	25	Kingdom of Coilon	In this country the heat of the sun can scarcely be endured ; if you put an egg into any river, it will be boiled before you have gone any great distance.

3	PART 1	26	Comari (Cape Comorin)	Comari is a country of India, remarkable in this respect, that the north-star, which we had not seen since leaving Java, appeared to us when thirty miles out at sea, rising about a cubit above the horizon.

3	PART 1	27	Eli or Dely	Ships come from Manji and other parts in the summer, load in eight days, and depart as soon as possible, there being no port, but dangerous sandbanks.

3	PART 1	28	Melibar or Malabar	These wicked corsairs form what they call a ladder on the sea ; twenty of them place themselves five miles from each other, and thus command a hundred miles in extent.
3	PART 1	28	Melibar or Malabar	When a merchantman comes in view, a light is kindled, which is repeated by one after another; so that no vessel sailing here can escape them.

3	PART 1	30	Tana (Bombay)	But I have a bad thing to tell you ; for many pirates issue hence, scouring the sea, and greatly injuring the sailors; and the king sanctions their conduct, having made an agreement, that they bring to him all the horses captured, which are very numerous, being in great request over all India.
3	PART 1	30	Tana (Bombay)	But gold, silver, precious stones, and the rest of the cargo, belong to themselves.

3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	The archbishop has no connexion with the See of Rome, but is subject to a primate resident at Bagdad, who appoints him, as well as sends mandates to bishops and prelates in other quarters of the world.
3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	Hither, too, repair many corsairs with their ships, to sell their booty, and find a ready market, because the Christians, knowing it to have been abstracted from idolaters and Saracens, scruple not to purchase.
3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	They perform many other marvellous enchantments, which it would be wrong to relate; they would excite such amazement.
3	PART 1	34	Isle of Socotra	We shall therefore leave them, and describe the island of Madagascar.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	This is an island towards the south, about a thousand miles from Scotra.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	The people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed ; and they have four sheiks, or old men, who rule the entirecountry.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	This is really one of the noblest and greatest islands in the world, being reputed 4000 miles in circuit.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	In no region are so many elephants bred, and their teeth sold, as here and in Zanghibar.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	No flesh is eaten but that of camels, of which an incredible number are killed every day ; and being supposed better and more wholesome than any other, it is used if possible during the whole year.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	t The red sandal grows here to the height of our forest trees, and is sold with advantage to foreigners.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	Ambergris also abounds, from the number of whales which, as you know, yield that substance.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	There are leopards, ounces, and lions ; likewise various other animals, such as stags, wild goats, and deer, some of great size.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	The birds are equally various, several wonderfully different from ours.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	Many ships arrive with abundance of goods, as cloths of silk and gold, which are profitably exchanged for those of the country.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	Mariners, however, cannot reach the other islands lying south of this and of Zanghibar, owing to the violence of the current running in this direction.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	It is such, that while vessels can come hither from Malabar in twenty days, they spend three months in returning.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	Now I must mention, that in these southern isles, the birds called griffon are reported to exist, and to appear at certain seasons ; yet they are not formed as we describe and paint them, half-bird, half-lion, but exactly like the eagle, only immeasurably larger.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	They are represented so huge and powerful, as to take up the elephant and carry him high into the air, then let him drop, whereby he is at once killed, and they feed upon his carcass.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	It is asserted that their wings are twelve paces long, and when spread out, extend thirty paces across ; they are thick in proportion.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	I must add, that the khan sent messengers to obtain information about the country, and also the release of one of his subjects who had been made prisoner.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	They and the captive related to him many great wonders of these strange isles, and brought teeth of a wild boar, inconeeivably large: I assure you, he found them to weigh fourteen pounds.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	You may thus judge as to the size of the boar ; and indeed some are equal to a buffalo.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	There are also giraffes and wild asses, and other beasts and birds wonderfully different from ours.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	To return to the griffon; the people .
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	of the island do not know it by that name, but call it always ruc; but we, from their extraordinary size, certainly conclude them to be griffons.
3	PART 1	35	Madagascar	Having nothing more to tell of this island, I will go on to that of Zanghibar.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	This is a very great and noble island, about 2000 miles in circuit.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	The people are all idolaters, have languages and a king of their own, and are subject to no other power.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	They are not very tall, but so broad and thick, that in this respect they appear like giants ; and they are likewise immensely strong, bearing as large a burden as four other men, which is really no wonder, for they eat as much as five.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	They are perfectly black, and go naked, with the exception of a cloth round the waist.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	Their mouth is so wide, their nose so turned up, their lips and eyes so big, that they are horrible to behold,and any one meeting them in another country would believe them devils.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	Elephants abound, and a great traffic is carried on in their teeth ; likewise lions of a peculiar species, with ounces and leopards.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	In short, they have all kinds of beasts different from others in.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	the world ; including sheep entirely white, with only the head black, and none of any other colour.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	Here too is the giraffe, a most beautiful creature, whose shape I will describe.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	Behind, it is low, and the legs very short ; while those before, and the neck, are very large, so that its head rises three paces from the ground.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	The animal is small, and is quite harmless; and its colour being red and white, in circles, it is very beautiful.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	t But there is a thing which I had forgotten about the elephant, that it caresses the female in the same manner as the human species.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	I must say, the women of this island are most ugly objects; with large mouth, eyes, and nose, and their breasts four times the ordinary size; in short, they are hideous.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	The people live on rice, flesh, milk, and dates, and though they have no vines, make a very good liquor of rice, sugar, and spices.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	There is a great trade, particularly in elephants’ teeth; and a good quantity of amber.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	The men are very brave in combat, and have little fear of death.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	They have no horses, but fight upon camels and elephants, placing on them castles well covered, with sixteen or twenty men mounted on them, bearing lances, swords, and staves, and making a very powerful force in battle.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	They have no arms except leathern shields, lances, and swords, with which they fight well.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	When leading the elephant to the combat, they give him to drink of their wine or liquor, which renders him more -fierce and effective.
3	PART 1	36	Coast of Zanghibar	I must now proceed to the great province of Abascia, but first wish to say something more of India in general.
3	PART 1	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	You must know I have described only its noblest Kingdoms and isles; those that make the flower of the region, and to which the rest are mostly subject.
3	PART 1	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	No man could enumerate all the islands ; they are estimated at 12,700, inhabited and uninhabited, according to the writings of the most skilful mariners.
3	PART 1	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	In the Greater India, which extends from Maabar to Kesmacoran, are thirteen very great kingdoms, of which I have described ten.
3	PART 1	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	The Lesser India, stretching from Zinaba to Montifi, contains eight, and this is exclusive of numerous others that are in the islands.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	Abascia is a very great province, called the Middle India.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The supreme monarch isa Christian ; the other six kings are subject to him, three being believers, and three Saracen.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The christian people of this province have three marks upon their face, one from the forehead to the middle of the nose, and one on each cheek, made with a hot iron, and herein consists their baptism.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	There are also Jews having a mark on each cheek, and Saracens with only one on the forehead and nose.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	* The great king lives in the middle of the province; the Saracens towards Aden.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	In this district Messer St Thomas the apostle preached, and after converting the inhabitants, went to Maabar, where he died, and his body remains, as formerly mentioned.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	This country contains many good men-at-arms and well mounted cavalry, who are much needed; for wars are frequent with the Sultans of‘Adent and Nubia, and with other powers.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	But I will tell you a memorable story of what happened in the year 1288.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	This king, who is lord over all Abascia, wished to go in pilgrimage to adore the sepulchre of Christ in Jerusalem.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The barons represented the danger of the journey, and advised him to send a bishop or some other great prelate.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The monarch having agreed, one of very holy life was chosen, who readily undertook the mission.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	He was equipped most handsomely as a pilgrim, and travelled by land and sea till he arrived at Jerusalem.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	Repairing to the sepulchre, he performed the due homage before an object so exalted; and having presented great offerings from the king, and well fulfilled his mission, he set out on his return.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	He passed through Aden, a country where Christians are hated as mortal enemies.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The governor, learning that he professed this religion, and was a messenger of the sovereign of Abascia, warned him, that unless he embraced the law of Mohammed, he would suffer a shameful punishment.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The bishop replied, that he would sooner die.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The other, greatly enraged, ordered him to be forcibly circumcised, and then sent him away, telling him that this was meant as an affront to his master.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The prelate was much grieved, but consoled himself by thinking that he had suffered for the law of his faith, and God would recompense him in the other world.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	As soon as he could travel, he proceeded to Abascia, and appeared before the king; who, having inquired about the sepulchre, and being told the whole truth, accounted it a most holy and pious visit.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The bishop then related the affront put upon him by the ruler of Aden, when his majesty fell into such a transport of grief and rage, that he almost died.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	He called aloud in the hearing of all the bystanders, that he would never wear a crown, nor rule a province, till he had taken such vengeance as should be spoken of throughout the world.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	Presently he prepared a vast body of troops, on horseback and foot, also elephants with well-armed castles, having twenty men upon each.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	He then set out and marched directly onward to the territory of Aden.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	Its chiefs, with a great multitude of Saracens on foot and horseback, came to defend their country, and a most obstinate battle was fought ; but the enemy could not withstand the force of the King of Abascia, because the Christians are more valiant.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	They ficd and were slain in great numbers.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The victor, entering the country in three or four places, greatly wasted and destroyed it, killing many of the inhabitants.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	He then thought the affront sufficiently avenged; and indeed I must tell you he could effect no farther devastation, the region being extensive, and full of dangerous passes, where a few men could greatly harass an army.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	I will now relate other matters of Abascia, which yields a great variety of all things necessary for subsistence.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	The people live on rice, flesh, milk, and sesamum, and have elephants, not bred there, but brought from the isle of the other India.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	Giraffes, however, are in great numbers ; also lions, leopards, ounces, wild apes, and many beasts and birds different from ours, The domestic fowls are the most beautiful in the world ; and the ostriches as large as asses.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	They have parrots, beautiful and various ; also monkeys and cats of two species, with faces exactly like those of men.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	This Abascia contains numerous cities and castles, and is much frequented by merchants; many cloths of cotton and buckram are wrought there.
3	PART 1	38	Kingdom of Absscia	I might relate other things, but must now go on to the province of Aden.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	This country is subject to a lord, called sultan.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	The people are all Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and wishing the greatest mischief to Christians.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	‘There are many cities and castles; for Aden is the port to which the Indian ships bring all their merchandise.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	It is then placed on board other small vessels, which ascend a river about seven days, at the end of which it is disembarked, laden on camels, and conveyed thirty days farther.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	It then comes to the river of Alexandria, and is conveyed down to that city.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	By this route alone its inhabitants receive their pepper, spices, and costly goods.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	* From Aden, too, ships sail for India with various goods, especially very fine and valuable horses, which, as you know, are sold there for full a hundred marks of silver.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	The sultan draws a great revenue from the duties on these cargoes ; and is thus one of the richest princes in the world.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	But, I assure you, he did great injury to the Christians ; for when the governor of Babylonia attacked and took the city of Acre, committing much devastation, he was assisted by this prince with 30,000 horses and 40,000 camels.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	This aid was given rather out of hatred to believers than good-will to that prince.
3	PART 1	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	But now I will tell you of another great city.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	You must know, that the gulf containing this island is called that of Zin, meaning in their language the sea opposite to Manji.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	According to skilful and intelligent mariners, who have made the voyage, it contains 7448 isles, mostly inhabited.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	In all these there grows no tree which is not agreeably fragrant, and also useful, being equal or superior in size to the lignum aloes.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	They produce also many and various spices, including pepper white like snow, as well as the black.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	They yield also much gold, and various other wonderful and costly productions ;but they are very distant and difficult to reach.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	The mariners of Zai-tun and Kin-sai, who visit them, gain indeed great profits; but they spend a year on the voyage, going in winter, and returning in the summer ; for the wind in these seasons blows only from two different quarters, one of which carries them thither, and the other brings them back.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	But this country is immensely distant from India.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	You may observe, too, that though the sea be called Zin, it is really the ocean, just as we say the sea of England, the sea of Rochelle.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	The great khan has no power over these islands.
3	PART 1	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	Now let us return to Zai-tun, and resume our narrative.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	Escier is a very large town to the north-west (north), four hundred miles from Aden.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	A count here rules with justice, but subject to the soldan of Aden ; and the people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	‘The port is good, frequented by many ships and merchants from India, who bring various commodities, and carry away others, particularly horses of great value, and yielding large profit.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	In this province grows a great quantity of fine incense, also of dates.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	They have no grain except rice, and little of that ; hence corn is profitably imported from other countries, Fish is caught in sach plenty, that for a Venetian gros you may purchase two large tunnies.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	The people live on rice, flesh, and fish, and have no wine except what they make from sugar, rice, and dates.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	But I must tell you, too, that they have sheep without ears, or any opening for them ; but where the ears should be, is a little horn; these are small and very beautiful creatures.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	Another thing you will much wonder at is, that all the animals, sheep, oxen, and camels, eat fish, because there is no grass, for it is the most arid place in the world.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	These fishes are very small, caught in March, April, and May, in wonderful quantities.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	They are dried, lodged in houses, and given as food to the animals during the whole year.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	The people eat them also when quite alive and newly taken.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	There are also plenty of large ones, which being made into a kind of biscuit, by cutting them into small pieces and drying them in the sun, are preserved under cover during the whole year.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	* The incense, mentioned as so abundant, is purchased by their lord at ten golden bezants the cantar, and retailed to the merchants for forty, so that he makes a very large profit.
3	PART 1	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	Let us now leave this city, and tell you of Dufar.
3	PART 1	41	City of Dufar	This is a beautiful, large, and noble city, 500 miles south-west from Escier.
3	PART 1	41	City of Dufar	The people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and ruled by a count, who is subject to Aden, to which, indeed, this city belongs.
3	PART 1	41	City of Dufar	The port is very good, and merchants convey thence many very fine Arabian horses, Numerous cities and castles depend upon it, and the country yields much incense.
3	PART 1	41	City of Dufar	The trees are about the size of a small fir, and incisions are made with knives in various places, whence flows the incense, which, indeed, through the great heat, often runs out of itself.
3	PART 1	41	City of Dufar	I shall now proceed to relate of the Gulf of Calatu.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	Calatu is a large city within the gulf of the same name, six hundred miles north-west from Dufar.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	It is a noble seaport, inhabited by Saracens, who are subject to Cormos.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	When the melik of that city is at war with a more powerful prince, he retires to this place, which is strong by nature and art, and finds himself secure.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	The people have no grain but what they import.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	Many ships bring the goods and spices of India, which are distributed throughout the interior, and many fine horses sent in return.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	But I must observe, that this city is at the mouth of the Gulf of Calatu, so that the melik can prevent vessels from sailing in or out without hisconsent.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	This power he often uses against the sultan of Creman ; for when that prince demands any exorbitant tribute from him or other vassals, they remove from Cormos to Calatu, and allow no ships to pass, whence the other prince suffers severely, and is obliged to abate his demands.
3	PART 1	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	The people of this country live on dates and salt fish, which are abundant ; but many rich men are well supplied with better food.
3	PART 1	43	Return to Cormos	After departing from Calatu, and sailing three hundred miles between north-west and north, you find the city of Cormos ;but if you take a direction from the former place between north-west and north, and sail five hundred miles, you come to Quis.
3	PART 1	43	Return to Cormos	However, we shall pass over this last place, and speak of Cormos, a large and noble capital, subject to a melik, who commands many townsand castles.
3	PART 1	43	Return to Cormos	The people are Saracens, and adore Mohammed.
3	PART 1	43	Return to Cormos	The heat is very great, on which account every house is provided with ventilators placed on the side whence the wind blows, which being thus admitted, renders the mansion tolerably cool.
3	PART 1	43	Return to Cormos	We gave an account of this place formerly, as well as of Quis and Creman, but have since made a circuit which brought us back to it.
3	PART 1	43	Return to Cormos	However, we will say no more, but proceed now to the description of Great Turkey.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	This country lies to the north-west as you go from Cormos to the river Gihon, extending towards the terTitory of the great khan.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	It is governed by a nephew (cousin) of his, named Kaidu, grandson of Ciagatai, brother to that monarch.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	He isa very powerful lord, ruling many cities and castles.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	His subjects are Tartars, very able combatants, much inured to fighting, and he does not obey the khan, but is rather at perpetual war with him.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	This is because Kaidu demanded constantly from that monarch a share of his conquests, particularly in Catai and Manji.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	The latter said he would willingly grant it to him, as to his other descendants, if he would come to his court and council whenever summoned.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	But the other, afraid to trust his uncle, offered to obey him where he was, but dreaded that if in his power he would be put to death.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Hence arose this discord, and the khan drew his forces around the realm of Kaidu to guard against an invasion; yet that prince contrived to penetrate, and fought repeatedly with the armies of Kublai; for he could bring into the field 100,000 brave and skilful horsemen.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	He had with him also many lords of the imperial lineage.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Each soldier carries to battle sixty arrows, thirty smaller for shooting, and thirty larger, pointed with heavy iron, to throw against the face or arms of the enemy, or cut the cords of his bow; and when they have discharged all these, they lay their hand on their swords, and strike most terrible blows.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Now, in the year 1266, this king, with his cousin named Jesudar, assembled a very great army, and marched against two barons that were also his relations, but held their lands from the great khan.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Kaidu and his cousin fought with these two chiefs, who had also a very large force, so that between them there were 100,000 horsemen.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	They contended hardly and long, and many fell on both sides; but at last Kaidu conquered; however, the two barons, being well mounted, escaped without injury.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	The victor then became still more proud and boastful; yet he returned home and remained two years in peace.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Then he assembled a mighty host of cavalry, having learned that at Karakorum there was a great army under Nomogan, a son of the khan, and George, a grandson of Prester John.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	He marched thither with all speed, and the two chiefs being informed of his approach, courageously prepared to meet him with their horsemen, amounting to upwards of 60,000.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Having reached the place where his men were ranged in tents on the plain, they skilfully established their own camp.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Each party rested and made preparations for three days, when they advanced to the combat.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	There was little advantage on either side ; both having about 60,000 mounted men well armed at every point, divided into six squadrons of 10,000.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	They waited only till they heard their lord sound the maccar ; meantime performing loudly on various musical instruments.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	At length the signal was given, when the hosts rushed against each other, laying their hands on their bows.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	The arrows filled the air like rain; men and horses were mortally wounded ; noise and cries arose so loud that the thunder of Jove could not have been heard.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Truly this was an evil hour for many, who on both sides fell dead and dying.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	The arrows being discharged, they rushed on with sword and spear, giving and receiving most dreadful blows.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	You might see arms and hands cut off, and numbers of men rolling senseless on the earth.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Kaidu displayed signal prowess, and his soldiers would have often been driven off the field, had he not encouraged and rallied them.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	On the other side, the two princes also firmly stood their ground, and it really was one of the most cruel battles ever fought between Tartar tribes.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Yet though each strove with all his might to discomfit the other, neither could succeed, and the conflict lasted tillevening.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	On this fatal day, multitudes of men fell, many wives were made widows, children made orphans, and households filled with tears and lamentations.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	But when the sun set, the struggle could endure no longer, and both parties returned to their camp overpowered with fatigue, happy to rest during the night.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	When morning dawned, King Kaidu, having received intelligence that the great khan was marching against him with a mighty host, deemed it unsafe to remain longer.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Wherefore he and all his men mounted and rode off to their own country ; the two princes were so exhausted, that they did not attempt to follow, so that he with his people reached Samarcand, the capital of his kingdom.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	The great khan felt much wrath at Kaidu for committing such ravages, and bethought himself, that had he not been his nephew, he would have seized his land and put him to a cruel death; but regard to his own flesh restrained him.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	Thus he escaped out of the hand of the mighty monarch.
3	PART 1	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	But I have wonderful stories to tell you about a daughter of this prince.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	This young lady was in Tartar named Aigiarm, which means in our language “ brilliant moon”.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	She such strength that none of the youths or nobles in the whole kingdom could vanquish her, but were all beaten.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	Her father wished to marry her to a baron; but she refused ever to unite herself to any one who could not vanquish her in fair combat; and the king granted her this privilege.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	She rejoiced greatly, and published through various parts of the world, that if any gentle youth would come, try her in pitched battle, and gain the victory, she would accept him for her lord.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	This news was spread wide through the surrounding countries, and I assure you many gentlemen came and made the trial, which was arranged in the following manner.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	The king, with many young nobles and ladies, assembled in the great hall of the palace, when the princess entered in a robe of cotton richly adorned, attended by youths similarly attired.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	The agreement was, that if the candidate prevailed and threw her to the ground, he should have her for his wife; but if victory declared on her side, he was to give her a hundred horses.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	Thus she had gained above ten thousand steeds, because she could find no youth or damosel that could overcome her ; nor was this wonderful, for she was large, tall, and wellformed in her limbs, indeed almost a giantess.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	Now, about the year 1280, there came the son of a rich king, an extremely handsome young man, with a brilliant retinue and a thousand very fine horses.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	He addressed himself to Kaidu, who was very desirous of marrying him to his daughter.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	He therefore caused her to be privately dealt with, to allow herself to be conquered; but she declared she would not do so for any thing in the world.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	One day then, the king and queen, with many nobles and ladies, assembled in the great hall; the princess and prince then entered, and their handsome appearance struck all with wonder; he was really so strong and powerful, that no one else could contend with him.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	When they were in the middle of the hall before this great assembly, the agreement was formally made, that the suitor, if vanquished, should lose his thousand horses.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	But all the company, as well as the king and queen, expressed their wishes that he should be successful.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	The two then rushed together, and wrestled violently, dragging each other in different directions: but at last the lady prevailed, and threw him on the ground, to the great grief of all the spectators; he thus forfeited the thousand horses.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	But I have to inform you, that Kaidu led this daughter to many battles, and in no encounter could any warrior withstand her.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	On many orrasions, she rushed among the enemy, seized one of the chiefs, and dragged him over to her own army.
3	PART 1	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	I will now, however, proceed to a great battle fought between her father and Argon, the son of Abaga, lord of the East.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	Abaga ruled many provinces bordering on those of Kaidu, and it was where grows the tree called in the book of Alexander the Arbor Secco.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	As that prince committed great ravages on his territory, he sent his son Argon, with a very large host of cavalry, into the country of the Arbor Secco, to the river of Gihon, where he took a station fitted to guard the country against the invader.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	Kaidu, however, assembled a great body of horsemen, and gave the command to a brother named Barak, very brave and skilful, desiring him to oppose the enemy.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	Barak, with his troops, rode on till they came to the river, and were ten miles distant from Argon.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	The latter, informed of the approach of his adversary, made diligent preparation ; the two remained three days in their respective camps.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	When they were fully prepared, and the naccar began to sound, they no longer delayed, but rushed furiously against each other.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	The arrows might be seen flying on all sides, and the air was so full of them, that it seemed to rain; and when both parties had discharged them, and many men as well as horses had been slain, they seized their swords and spears, and began a most fierce and cruel combat.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	Arms and legs were cut off, chargers killed, and many dreadful wounds inflicted ; the noise and cries were such as would have drowned the loudest thunder.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	I assure you, in a few hours the ground was covered with dead and dying.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	Finally, Barak and his men could not endure the force of their adversary, and retreated across the river ; while the victor pursued and killed a great number.
3	PART 1	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	Thus Argon gained the day ; and having begun to speak of him, I will relate his other adventures, and how he became sovereign lord after the death of Abaga, his father.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Not long after Argon had gained this battle, he received news of the death of Abaga.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He was much grieved, yet prepared with his whole host to return to the court, and take possession of the sovereignty ; but he had forty days to march before arriving there.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Nowa brother of the deceased monarch, named Acomat Soldan, who had become a Saracen, having heard of the event, bethought himself, that since the heir was so distant, he himself might succeed.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Having prepared a large body of men, he marched directly to the capital, and seized the supreme power.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He found such an amount of treasure, that it could scarcely be counted.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He lavished his bounty in a wonderful manner on the chiefs and barons, who declared him a good master, liked him, and wished for no other.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He studied to be popular, and to please all men; yet the action he had committed was vile, and blamed by many.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	It was not long till he learned that Argon was marching against him with a very powerful force.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He made no delay, nor showed surprise, but actively summoned his barons and troops ; and in a week he had assembled a numerous body of cavalry, who all marched cheerfully against Argon, expressing their earnest desire to kill or take him.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Soldan Acomat having thus assembled 60,000 horsemen, set out and marched full ten days without interruption, when he learned that Argon, with an equal force, was five days’ journey distant.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He pitched his camp and awaited the enemy in a large and beautiful plain, which seemed well adapted for the combat.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He then summoned his people, and thus addressed them :— “ My lords, you know how well I am entitled to succeed my brother, being son of the same father, and having accompanied him in all his conquests.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Because Argon is son to Abaga, some think he ought to succeed ; but with all due respect to them, I consider this unjust.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Even during my brother’s life, I was reasonably entitled to half the kingdom, only through my mildness I allowed him the whole, but now I ought to succeed.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	I pray you then to defend my right against Argon, and preserve to us the rule; for I seek only the name and dignity, and leave to you the profit and possession of all.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	I need say no more to wise men, who love justice, and will do all things for the general honour and benefit”.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	‘When the barons, chiefs, and soldiers heard this speech, they declared with one consent their resolution to adhere to him while they had breath, and defend him against all, and particularly Argon, whom they trusted they would capture and place in his hands.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	When that prince learned that his rival was waiting for him with so great a multitude, he was much discomposed ; he considered, however, how injurious it would be to show melancholy or fear, and the necessity of displaying valourand boldness.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He sent for his lords and counsellors, and having assembled a great number, thus addressed them :—“ My dear brothers and friends, you know well how tenderly my father loved you, regarding you while he lived as kindred and children ; also how many great battles you fought with him, aiding him to conquer all his kingdom.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Now I am the son of him who loved you so much, and to me you are equally dear; I therefore trust you will aid me against the man who seeks, contrary to all right and reason, to disinherit me.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Consider also, that he has forsaken our law and embraced that of Mohammed ; it were fitting indeed that a Saracen should rule over the Tartar nation!
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Therefore, friends and brothers, I trust that you will willingly and heartily support me, and that each will display such valour, that the battle may be ours, and we may comfort ourselves by thinking that the right is on our side”.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	After this speech, each lord and chief thought to himself, that he ought rather to die than not strenuously endeavour to gain atriumph.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	While the rest were silent, one great lord arose and said :—‘“ Noble sire, we know fully the truth of what you have said, and I will now answer in the name of all now present, that while life remains in our bodies, we are ready to die rather than fail to conquer.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Victory, too, appears to us certain, since we are so greatly in the right, and our enemies in the wrong.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	I advise, then, that we march as soon as possible against the foe, and pray all our companions to display such valour, that their deeds may be spoken of over the whole world”.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	That brave man having concluded, all present assented, and eagerly desired battle.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Next morning, Argon and his troops began their march, riding towards the plain on which their enemies were posted, and pitched their camp ten miles distant from that of Acomat.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Argon now chose two intelligent men, in whom he greatly confided, and sent them to his uncle.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	They mounted on horseback, went direct, and alighted at the pavilion of the soldan, whom they found with a numerous company of barons.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Being well acquainted, they saluted him courteously, and received a cheerful welcome.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	After some time, one of them rose and said,— “Noble sire, your nephew Argon wonders greatly at your seizing his kingdom, and coming thus to fight against him.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	This is not good conduct, nor due from an uncle towards a nephew; he therefore courteously prays you to abstain, and desiring neither war nor quarrel, will respect you as superior and father, both of himself and of the whole country”.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Acomat answered,— ‘My lords messengers, my nephew is entirely mistaken ; the land is mine, I conquered it along with his father.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	If he will consent, I will make him a great lord, endowing him with spacious estates, treating him as my son and the highest under myself; otherwise, be assured, I will endeavour to put him to death”.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	The envoys then asked repeatedly, if they could hope for no other determination.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He replied, never in his lifetime.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	They then departed, and rode to the camp of their lord, alighted at the tent, and told him his uncle’s declaration.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	Argon was greatly enraged, and said aloud in the hearing of all, that he would never live in comfort till the whole world had seen the signal vengeance he would take on his uncle.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	He said to his chiefs,—“ Now let us without further delay march against these traitors and endeavour to destroy them”.
3	PART 1	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	The night was spent in busy preparation ; and Acomat Soldan, being warned by his spies, was equally active.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	Next day Argon, having made all his arrangements, advanced in good order; while his antagonist, not waiting his arrival, led on his troops to the encounter.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	They soon met, and the two great hosts, who had much desired the battle, rushed without delay against each other.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	Arrows flew like rain, chiefs fell to the ground, the air resounded with the cries and lamentations of the wounded and dying.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	Their arrows being exhausted, they rushed on with swords and spears; arms, hands, and heads were cut off, and the noise would have drowned the loudest thunder, In that day many brave men died, and many ladies were left disconsolate.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	Argon assuredly displayed great prowess, and set a gallant example ; but in vain,—fortune turned against him,—his men, compelled to flee, were pursued and slain in great numbers.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	Among the fugitives, he himself was captured, when the pursuers stopped and returned with him to their camp, rejoicing beyond measure.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	Acomat caused him to be imprisoned and carefully guarded ; then, being of a voluptuous disposition, he returned to court to enjoy the society of his numerous and handsome wives.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	He instructed the commander of the host to guard the captive as himself, and return at leisure that his troops might not be fatigued.
3	PART 1	48	Great Battle between them	He then departed, while Argon remained in chains, and so grieved, that death appeared to him desirable.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Now there was a great and aged Tartar baron, who felt much pity for the prisoner, and bethought him how wicked it was to keep their lord in this condition.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	He resolved, therefore, to attempt his deliverance.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	He argued to this effect with many other chiefs, who, esteeming his wisdom, and conscious that he spake the truth, entirely agreed with him.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Then Boga, who had made the proposal, Elcidai, Togan, Tegana, Taga, Tiar Oulatai, and Samagar, all went to the tent of the captive prince.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	The first, asthe eldest and the leader, addressed him thus,—“ Noble prince, we are now fully sensible of having acted wickedly towards you, and have determined to return to the right path; we will therefore deliver and own you as justly our liege lord”.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Argon, who thought they were mocking him, was both grieved and angry.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	“ My lords,” said he, “ you have done wrong enough in seizing your sovereign and making him a captive.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Pray depart, and do not also make him a subject of mockery”.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	“ Illustrious prince,” said Boga, “ we positively speak the truth, and will make oath to it according to our law”.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Then all the barons swore that they would obey him as their lord, while he in return bound himself in no degree to resent past wrongs, but hold each of them as dear as Abaga his father had done.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	They then freed him from his chains, and did homage to him.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	He now ordered them to discharge their arrows against the tent of the melic; and that chief, named Soldan, who was the first after Acomat, and the commander of the whole host, was quickly slain.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Finding himself thus lord of all, he gave orders to march to the court, and was instantly obeyed.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	One day, thereafter, when Acomat was holding a splendid festival in his palace, a messenger came to him and said,—“ Sire, I bring you with regret unwelcome tidings ; the barons have delivered Argon, owned him as lord, and killed Soldan your faithful friend.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	They are coming now with their utmost speed to take and slay you”.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	He was then silent, but the other was completely amazed and terrified.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	However, as a bold and brave man, he ordered the messenger not to say a word to a living creature; then mounting on horseback, set out with a few trusty servants, to seek refuge with the Sultan of Babylon, leaving all in ignorance whither he had gone.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	After marching six days, he came to the only pass by which he could penetrate.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	The commander who guarded it knew him, and seeing him fleeing with only a few adherents, determined to seize him, Acomat entreated for mercy, and offered a great treasure as the price of liberty ; but the other, being greatly attached to Argon, replied that the wealth of the world would not prevent his placing him in his master’s hands.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	He prepared a large company, and set out with his captive, watching him so carefully as to make escape impossible.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	They rode on to the court, where Argon had arrived only three days before, and been much vexed to find that his uncle had escaped ; but when the guardian of the pass brought the fugitive before his presence, he felt the greatest possible joy.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	He received the latter sternly, telling him that he would meet with the treatment he deserved; and without asking any one’s advice, he commanded him to be led forth and slain, This mandate was speedily executed, and the body was thrown into a place where it was never seen more.
3	PART 1	49	Final Issue of the Contest	Thus have you heard the whole affair of Argon and of Acomat his uncle.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	On leaving that port, and sailing west and somewhat south-west 1500 miles, you reach a country named Cianba,which is very rich and extensive.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	The people are idolaters, have a language of their own, and 9 king, who pays tribute to the great khan, but only in fine elephants peculiar to the country.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	That monarch, seeking to subdue him, sent, in 1278, one of his barons with many men, horse and foot, who began to lay waste the country.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	The sovereign, who was very aged and much afraid of such powerful warriors, did not venture to engage them on the open plain, remaining secure in strong cities and fortresses ; but all the lands and houses were wasted and destroyed.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	Grieved at the desolation of the territory, he sent messengers, who said to the great khan, “ Sir, the King of Cianba salutes you as his liege lord, and states himself to be a man of great age, who has long preserved his kingdom in peace.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	He offers to be your vassal, and pay a liberal tribute in elephants, and beseeches that your baron and army will cease to ravage his kingdom”.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	The khan, having heard this message, took pity upon him, and ordered his general to withdraw, and conquer another country ; and he has ever since received this tribute of the largest and most beautiful elephants.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	t In this kingdom, no handsome girl can be married till the king sees her, when, if pleased, he takes her to wife ; otherwise, he gives her money, with which she can be married to a nobleman.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	In 1285, when I, Marco Polo, was there, the king had 326 sons and daughters, of whom 150 were men that could carry arms.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	Besides elephants, the country abounds in lignum aloes, and the wood called ebony,which is very black, used in making chess-boards and writingdesks.
3	PART 1	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	I now proceed to a great island named Java.
3	PART 1	50	Reign of Argon	Argon was thus master of the palace andof the kingdom, and the barons from every quarter came to render him due homage and obedience.
3	PART 1	50	Reign of Argon	After governing some time, he sent Casan his son with 30,000 men, to the country of the Arbor Secco, there to guard and secure his land and people.
3	PART 1	50	Reign of Argon	Argon began his reign in the year 1286, after Acomat had ruled two years.
3	PART 1	50	Reign of Argon	The former, after holding the sceptre six years, died, not without strong suspicions of poison.
3	PART 1	51	Reign of Quiacatu	When Argon was dead, his uncle, named Quiacatu, brother to Abaga, immediately seized the throne, which was easily effected, as Casan was distant at the Arbor Secco.
3	PART 1	51	Reign of Quiacatu	The latter, when informed of these eyents, was much grieved at the death of his parent, and still more incensed at Quiacatu having seized his inheritance.
3	PART 1	51	Reign of Quiacatu	He was afraid, however, to march at once against him, but resolved, that at the proper time and place he would take as signal vengeance as his father had done on Acomat.
3	PART 1	51	Reign of Quiacatu	Thus Quiacatu obtained general obedience, except over the troops whom Casan immediately commanded.
3	PART 1	51	Reign of Quiacatu	He married the wife of Argon his nephew, and indulged largely in the pleasures of the seraglio.
3	PART 1	51	Reign of Quiacatu	At the end of two years, however, his death ensued, being occasioned by poison.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	Baidu, his uncle, and aChristian, then seized the sovereignty, and was generally obeyed, unless by Casan and hisarmy.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	The latter, on learning these things, regretted much that he had not been able to punish Quiacatu, but determined to take such vengeance on Baidu, that the world might admire it.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	He marched without delay against that chief, who, informed of his approach, assembled a great force, and marched ten days’ journey to meet him, when he encamped, and awaited his adversary, earnestly exhorting and encouraging his troops.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	In two days Casan came up, and immediately a battle began, most bloody and desperate ; but it was vain for Baidu to struggle, since, as soon as the contest commenced, many of his men went over and fought on the side of his opponent.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	He was accordingly discomfited, and killed.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	Casan, thus victorious, immediately marched to court and assumed the sovereignty, when all the barons paid him homage and obedience ; and this was in the year 1294.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	* Thus have you heard the whole train of affairs from Abaga down to Casan.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	You must likewise know that Alau, who conquered Bagdad, and was brother to Kublai, was ancestor to all the princes now named ; for he was the father of Abaga, grandfather of Argon, who was the parent of Casan, now reigning.
3	PART 1	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	Having told you all about these Tartars of the East, I might go on to treat of Great Turkey ; but the truth is, I have done so already, mentioning all the acts of Kaidu, so that I have nothing more to say, and shall therefore now tell you of the provinces and people that lie to the northward.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	In this quarter isa king named Conci.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	He and all his people are Tartars, and adhere to the rudest and most brutal customs of that nation, never having changed since the time of Gengis Khan.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	They have a god of felt, named Nacigai, to whom they also give a wife, calling these two lords of the earth, who guard all their corn, beasts, and landed property ; and when they get any victuals, they anoint with them the mouth of these deities.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	The king is independent, being of the imperial lineage of Gengis, and a near relation of the great khan.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	He has neither cities nor castles, but his people reside in vast plains, diversified with valleys and mountains.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	They are very submissive to him, and he successfully studies to preserve among them peace and union.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	* They have no grain, but live on milk and cattle, which abound, including camels, horses, oxen, sheep, and other animals.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	There are also bears, white all over, and longer than twenty palms, with foxes, large and black ; likewise a great number of sables, whose costly skins I have mentioned as worth each a thousand bezants.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	The rats of Pharaoh are plentiful, and very large, affording food to the people during the whole summer.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	In short, all kinds of wild beasts abound in this savage and.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	trackless region.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	I must also mention, that this king has a country in which horses cannot travel, on account of the numerous lakes and fountains, and the quantity of ice and mud.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	This rugged tract extends thirteen days’ journey, and at the end of each is a post-house to accom modate the messengers, with about forty dogs, almost as large as asses, to convey them from one post to the other.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	As wheeled carriages cannot travel here, they employ sledges, so formed as to move over the surface without sinking ; such, indeed, as are used in this country to convey hay and straw when there is great rain and mud.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	On the sledge is spread a bear’s skin, whereon the messenger sits, and the dogs drag it direct to the following post.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	The guardian mounts a similar carriage, and guides him by the best and nearest way.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	At the next post, they find another relay of sledges and dogs, and the one which conveyed them returns.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	The men dwelling in this wild country are very expert hunters, capturing many precious little animals, such as sables, ermines, and black foxes, whose skins yield a large profit.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	They have engines so well contrived that no animal can escape.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	But owing to the extreme cold, all their habitations are under ground.
3	PART 1	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	Having nothing more to mention, we shall depart and treat of a place where there is perpetual twilight.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	You must know, that beyond this kingdom is a province called Obscurity, because there never appears either sun, moon, or star; but it is always dark, as with us during twilight.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	The people have no ruler, but live like brutes.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	The Tartars, however, make occasional in roads in the following manner:—They ride on mares that have just brought forth foals, which last are left at the border.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	They then traverse the country, plundering whatever they can find ; and when they wish to return, the mares, seeking to find their young, know the way better than the riders.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	The people are all hunters, and take.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	great numbers of sables, black foxes, and other animals with costly furs.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	Those on their frontier meet them at a fixed period, purchase these skins, and sell them elsewhere with an ample profit.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	These people are tall and well made, but pale and colourless.
3	PART 1	54	The Region of Obscurity	The territory borders on one side upon Great Russia, of which I shall now proceed to speak.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	Russia is a very great province towards the north, inhabited by Christians, who follow the Greek Church.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	They have languages of their own, and several kings.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	They are a very simple people, but extremely handsome, with a faircomplexion.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	The entrances and passes into it are very strong ; they own some small allegiance to the Tartar king of the West, named Toctai.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	The country yields few commodities, except an abundance of the furs already described, equal to any in the world.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	There are considerable silver mines.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	But now let us leave it, and describe the Greater Sea, with the provinces around.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	But first let me tell you of a province lying between north and north-west, and bordering on Russia, named Lac, inhabited by a mixture of Christians and Saracens, and subject to a king.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	The people carry on merchandise and manufactures, and have a vast variety also of valuable furs.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	t But now I must go back to Russia, and mention something that I had forgot.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	It is so very extensive as to reach the ocean, where are isles on which pilgrim-falcons and gerfalcons are found, and carried to various parts of the world.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	Now from Russia to Oroech is no great distance ; but the extreme cold renders the journey very difficult.
3	PART 1	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	This would be the time to speak of the Strait of Constantinople and the mouth of the Great Sea; but on considering that many others have written on the subject, we shall omit them, and proceed to treat of the Tartars of the West, and the lords by whom they are ruled.
3	PART 1	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	The first lord of these Tartars was Sain, a very great and powerful king.
3	PART 1	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	He conquered Russia, Comania, Alania, Lac, Mengiar, Zic, Gucia, and Gazaria.
3	PART 1	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	The inhabitants had all been Comanian ; but having no unity or connexion, lost their country, and were driven into various parts of the world, while those who remained became servants of this conqueror.
3	PART 1	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	After him reigned successively Patu, Barka, Mungletemur, Totamongur, and Toctai, the present sovereign.
3	PART 1	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	Having thus recounted the kings of the Western Tartars, I will now describe a great battle fought between Alau, lord of the East, and Barka, lord of the West, with the occasion which led to it.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	You must know that about the year 1261 there arose a great discord between these two monarchs.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	It was about a province on their respective frontier which each desired and would not yield, but resolved to seize it and see who would oppose him.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	Thereupon they declared war, summoned their respective subjects, and made the greatest preparation almost ever known.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	I assure you, in six months each had assembled full 300,000 horsemen, well provided with every warlike implement.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	Alau, lord of the East, then set out with all his troops, and having rode many days, reached a wide plain between the Iron Gates and the Sea of Sarain.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	There he pitched his camp, which, I have heard, contained many rich tents, and made a splendid appearance.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	Being here on the frontier, he resolved to wait, and see if Barka would come.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	That prince having completed his preparations, and learned the approach of his foe, without delay began his march.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	He rode on till he came to the great plain where his enemy was posted, and pitched his camp at ten miles’ distance.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	I declare to you, it was fully as beautiful as that of Alau, filled with tents and pavilions of cloth of gold.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	His army, too, was more numerous, amounting, without a lie, to 350,000 horsemen.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	They rested two days in their tents, when Barka thus addressed his men :—“ Noble chiefs, you know how, since coming to the sovereignty, I have loved you as brothers and sons; you have accompanied me in many great battles, and aided in conquering much territory.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	Alau, a great and powerful prince, proposes wrongfully to fight against us; but having the right on our side, we may confidently expect to conquer, especially since our army is more numerous.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	In this confidence, then, noble chiefs, and having come so far for battle, let us prepare in three days to engage, arranging so wisely, and displaying such valour, that our fame may spread over the world”.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	He was then silent ; and we must now return to his antagonist, who, when he heard of his adversary’s arrival with so great an army, assembled his principal men and said :—“ Noble brethren and friends, you have throughout all my life supported and aided me, enabling me to conquer in many battles; nor indeed ever fighting one in which we were not victorious.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	We have come here to combat the great Barka, who indeed has as many and even more troops ; but ours are braver, and I feel confident of victory.
3	PART 1	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	I rejoice, then, to hear by the spies, that he is coming to give us battle in three days, and I expect every one to be well prepared, with his accustomed bravery, rather to die on the field with honour, than to suffer disgrace and discomfiture”.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	On the appointed day Alau rose early, summoned his men to arms, and ranged them very skilfully in order of battle.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	He formed thirty squadrons, each containing 10,000 horsemen, making in all the number of 300,000, with able leaders and captains.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	By his order his squadrons then advanced at a moderate pace over the plain, till they arrived mid-way between the two camps, where they stopped and awaited the enemy.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	On the same morning, Barka similarly arranged his men, forming thirty-five squadrons of 10,000 each, with good officers and commanders.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	He then made his troops ride forward to within half a mile of the enemy, when they halted, and again proceeded till the hosts, being within two bow-shots of each other, stopped and arranged their squadrons.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	The plain was the largest and finest in all that country ; which, assuredly, was very necessary to afford a field of battle for such mighty armies, amounting to 650,000 men.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	Indeed Alau and Barka were the most powerful princes in the world, and were near relations too,—being both of the imperial lineage of Gengis Khan.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	The two great kings with all their troops being thus marshalled, impatiently waited for the naccar as a signal of battle.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	When it sounded, the armies rushed forward and discharged arrows against each other.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	The air was filled, and the sky became invisible; numbers of men and horses fell to the earth, which was covered with dead and dying.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	The arrows being exhausted, they struck dreadful blows with swords and spears ; assuredly there had not for a long time been a battle in the world fought by such numerous armies.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	Alau, most brave and powerful in arms, showed himself this day worthy of ruling a kingdom and wearing a crown.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	He displayed signal prowess in his own person, and by his example infused extraordinary courage into his men.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	His achievements, indeed, astonished both friends and enemies ; he appeared, not aman, but thunder and tempest.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	Barka, too, fought most bravely, and made himeelf worthy of the admiration of the whole world ; but it was all in vain ; his men were either killed, or so overwhelmed and exhausted, that they could endure no longer.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	When evening arrived, they fied with their utmost speed.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	The victor and his troops rapidly pursued, and after committing dreadful slaughter returned, threw aside their arms, and had their wounds washed and dressed.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	They were, indeed, quite overpowered and exhausted.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	The night was spent in repose, and next day he ordered all the dead bodies both of friends and enemies to be burned.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	He then returned into his country with all the troops who survived the battle; for I assure you, although he conquered, he had lost a vast number, yet still more had fallen on the opposite side.
3	PART 1	58	Great Battle between them	Having told you thus of Alau and his victory, we shall go on to treat of a battle between the Tartars of the west.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	You must know that in this quarter the great lord of the Tartars was named Mongutemur, and he was suoceeded by Tolobuga, a very young man.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	Tofimangu, a powerful chief, aided by a king named Nogai,killed that prince and succeeded to the sovereignty.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	He died, however, soon after, and in his room was elected Toctai, a very wise and able chief.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	Meantime, two sons of the slain monarch having grown up to manhood, and being wise and prudent, assembled a large body of troops, and marched to the court of Toctai.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	They went and threw themselves on their knees before him, when he bid them welcome, and desired them to rise.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	The two youths then stood up, when the eldest began to speak thus :— Noble sire, we come as sons of Totamangu, who was killed by Tolobuga and Nogai.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	The former being dead, we can say nothing ; but we seek vengeance on Nogai, and pray that you, as his rightful lord, make him appear and account for the death of our father”.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	The youth was then silent, and Toctai, feeling that he had spoken truth, replied,—* My noble friend, I will willingly do what you ask”.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	He then sent two messengers with this injunction to Nogai, who laughed at it, and positively refused to come.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	They rode back and reported this answer, when their master, much enraged, said in the hearing of all around him,—“ If God aid me, either Nogai shall obey my mandate, or I will march with all my men to destroy him”.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	"He then sent two other messengers, who rode to the court of the Tartar, presented themselves, and saluted him, He bid them welcome, when one of them said,—""Noble sire, Toctai gives warning, that unless you come to his court to account for your conduct to the sons of Totamangu, he will march against you with all his people, and do you all the injury in his power ; therefore be careful what you do in this business, and what message you send”."
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	"The other wrathfully replied,—""Gentlemen, return to your lord, and tell him from me, that I little dread the threatened war, and am ready to come and meet him half-way”."
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	The messengers, on hearing this speech, without delay set out, and rode till they came to their master, and told him all that Nogai had said.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	Seeing that war was inevitable, he immediately sent his messengers to all his subjects, and summoned them to prepare and march against his adversary.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	And what shall I say!
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	He assembled the greatest armament in the world.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	When the Tartar prince heard this, he also made great preparations ; but his people being less numerous, he could not assemble an equal army; however it was very powerful.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	When Toctai was fully ready to take the field, he set out, leading with him, I assure you, two hundred thousand horsemen.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	He rode on to the large and beautiful plain of Nerghi, and there pitched his camp.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	Hither also came the two sons of Totamangu, with a noble company of men, to avenge the death of their father.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	Now jet us turn to Nogai, who on learning his approach set.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	out with all his troops, and, without doubt, they were upwards of 150,000 horsemen, all good and valiant, better men at arms than those of the enemy.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	Two days after, he arrived and pitched his camp at ten miles distance.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	On both sides were seen very rich tents and pavilions of cloth of gold, fully displaying the wealth of these kings.
3	PART 1	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	They then waited a short time on the plain for refreshment and repose.
3	PART 1	6	The Island of Java	Departing from Cianba, and going south and southeast 1500 miles, you come to this island.
3	PART 1	6	The Island of Java	Good mariners, who know it intimately, describe it as the largest in the world, with a circuit of more than 3000 miles, The people are subject to a powerful king, are idolaters, and pay no tribute to any other prince.
3	PART 1	6	The Island of Java	The territory is very rich, yielding pepper, nutmegs, galanga, cubebs, cloves, and all the richest of spices.
3	PART 1	6	The Island of Java	Many merchants from Zai-tun and Manji come and carry on a great and profitable traffic.
3	PART 1	6	The Island of Java	Its treasure also is so immense, that it can scarcely be estimated.
3	PART 1	6	The Island of Java	On account of the long and difficult navigation, the great khan never could acquire dominion over it.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Toctar now assembled his people, and spoke as follows :—“ My lords, we have come to fight King Nogai, and with great reason, since all this feud and enmity have arisen from his not coming to account for his conduct to the sons of Totamangu.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Since then his behaviour is thus unreasonable, we must feel good courage and hope of conquest ; and I earnestly pray that each man be valiant, and strive to carry destruction and death among the enemy”.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	"The other, too, thus addressed his men :— ""Noble friends and brethren, you know how many great and hard battles we have gained, and against better men than now oppose us; therefore you may feel assured of victory."
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Besides, we are fully in the right, and he in the wrong ; for, as you know well, he is not my lord, nor entitled to call me to his court to give an account to others, I say no more, but pray every one to perform such exploits, that the whole world may admire them, and your name may always strike terror”.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	The two kings, having thus spoken, made no delay in forming their order of battle.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	The first drew out twenty squadrons, and his enemy fifteen, of 10,000 men each, with good captains and conductors.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Having rode on to within bow-shots, and the naccar having sounded, they rushed forward and discharged their arrows, when many horses and riders fell dead, loud cries arose, and tears were shed.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Afterwards they all advanced with sword and spear ; hands, heads, and arms were cut off ; knights fell dead and wounded to the earth ; the cries, noise, and clashing of arms, would have drowned the loudest thunder.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Never almost was there a battle in which such numbers fell ; but the greater loss was on the side of Toctai, for his adversary had better men-at-arms.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	The two sons of Totamangu displayed great prowess, striving to the utmost to avenge the death of their father; but it was in vain.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	The battle, in short, was most bloody and dreadful; many who in the morning were alive and vigorous, during the day fell slain, and many happy wives were made widows.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Toctai strove with all his might to support his people and his honour, and displayed indeed a prowess worthy to be praised by the whole world.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	He rushed amid the enemy like one that cared nothing for life or death, striking to right and left, rescuing his people when seized or taken.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	He did much injury that day both to enemies and friends; of the one he killed a vast number, and the other, from his example, derived boldness to push against their foe, and thus met instant death.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Nogai, on his side, equally acted the hero; he rushed among theenemy asthe lion does among other wild beasts, casting down and killing all whom he encountered.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	He threw himself among the thickest of the foe, and all fled before him like weak and timid animals.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	His troops emulated his valour ; but why make a long story !
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	The people of Toctai did every thing possible to support their honour, though in vain, for they had too good and stout men to deal with.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	They had suffered so much as to make it evident that if they remained they would all perish.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	They therefore took to flight as quickly as they could, the victor with his troops pursuing and killing them in great numbers.
3	PART 1	60	Great Battle	Thus have you heard how Nogai gained the battle, and be assured there died in it 60,000 men ; but the other king escaped, as well as the two sons of Totamangu.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	You have now been informed of all the actions of the Tartars and Saracens, of their customs, and of other countries throughout the world, so far as they could be searched out and discovered.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	We have only declined saying any thing of the Black Sea and the surrounding provinces, although we fully explored them, because it would seemingly have been useless, and a repetition of what others relate every day.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	The Venetians, the Genoese, the Pisans, and many other nations, are continually navigating it, so that every one knows the bordering countries.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	You have been informed in a chapter at the beginning, of our departure from the great khan, and the trouble and solicitation which Maffio, Nicolo, and Marco had in obtaining his permission.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	You have learned also the accident whereby it was procured, without which we should have found it very difficult to return into our country.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	But I believe it was the pleasure of God, that they might make known the great things that are in the world, and, as formerly declared in the preface, there never was a man, either Christian or Saracen, or Tartar or Pagan, who explored so much of the world as did Marco, the son of Nicolo Polo, that noble and great citizen of Venice.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	Deo Gratias.
3	PART 1	61	Conclusion	Amen, Amen.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	Leaving this island, and sailing between south and south-west 700 miles, you find two isles, a large and a small, called Sondur and Condur.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	Departing thence, and going south-east still 500 miles, you find a very extensive province named Lochac.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	The people are subject only to a native king, are idolaters, with languages of their own.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	They are tributary to no power, being so situated that no invader can reach their land ; otherwise it would soon be subdued by the great khan.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	Brazilwood is in abundance, and gold in almost incredible quantities.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	There are elephants and other animals for hunting; and from this place is derived all the porcelain that is circulated as money through the provinces now described.
3	PART 1	7	Kingdom of Lochac	I have only to add, that the country is difficult to reach; the king himself does not wish to be visited by strangers, and thus no one knows his treasure and condition.
3	PART 1	8	Pentam and other Islands	When a man goes 500 miles southward from Lochac, he finds an island named Pentam, very wild, all covered with odoriferous woods.
3	PART 1	8	Pentam and other Islands	Thence he navigates between these two islands about sixty miles, drawing only four paces of water, so that large vessels in the passage must remove their: rudder.
3	PART 1	8	Pentam and other Islands	He then goes on south-east about thirty miles, and reaches an island also named Pentam, with the noble and rich city Malauir, having much traffic in spices and other articles.
3	PART 1	8	Pentam and other Islands	The people have a king and languages of their own.
3	PART 1	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	Departing from Pentam, and going 130-miles south-east, you find the island of Java the Lesser; but notwithstanding this title, it is above two thousand miles in circuit, with eight kingdoms, and the same number of crowned sovereigns.
3	PART 1	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	I will tell you the whole truth about it.
3	PART 1	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	The people are idolaters, and each nation has a language of its own.
3	PART 1	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	There is a very great abundance of treasure and costly spices, as well as of lignum aloes and many other woods unknown in our country.
3	PART 1	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	What will appear very wonderful is, that this isle lies so far south, that the north star is never seen.
3	PART 1	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	Now I will tell you of each kingdom by itself.
