Melibar is a great kingdom towards the westward, with a sovereign and languages of its own.The people are idolaters, and subject to no foreigner. Here the northstar, at its greatest height, appears two cubits above the water. From this and an adjacent province named Gozurat, there issue annually a body of upwards of a hundred vessels, who capture other ships and plunder the merchants. Being sea-robbers, they carry with them their wives and children, and remain together all the summer, doing great injury to trade. These wicked corsairs form what they call a ladder on the sea ; twenty of them place themselves five miles from each other, and thus command a hundred miles in extent. When a merchantman comes in view, a light is kindled, which is repeated by one after another; so that no vessel sailing here can escape them. The mariners, however, knowing well their wicked customs, come well armed and prepared, and fight a desperate battle, often beating them off with loss ; but at other times fall into their hands. The pirates then take the ship with all the goods, but do no injury to the men, saying to them, “ Go and collect another cargo, that we may have a chance of getting it too.”  In this country is a vast abundance of pepper, and also of ginger, with a good supply of cinnamon and other spices, also cubebs and cocoa-nuts. Cotton cloths, the most beautiful and delicate in the whole world, are here manufactured, with other valuable articles.t To purchase these goods, the merchants from other quarters bring copper, which they use as ballast ; cloths of silk and gold, sandal-wood, and other spices. Ships come even from the great province of Manji; and the dealers here convey the goods to various quarters in the west, whence the most valuable are forwarded to Alexandria. Having told you now of Melibar, we shall go to Gozurat, but it would be too tedious to inform you of all the cities of these countries, they are so very numerous.
