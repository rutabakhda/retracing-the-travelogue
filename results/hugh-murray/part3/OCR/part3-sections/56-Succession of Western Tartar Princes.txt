The first lord of these Tartars was Sain, a very great and powerful king. He conquered Russia, Comania, Alania, Lac, Mengiar, Zic, Gucia, and Gazaria. The inhabitants had all been Comanian ; but having no unity or connexion, lost their country, and were driven into various parts of the world, while those who remained became servants of this conqueror. After him reigned successively Patu, Barka, Mungletemur, Totamongur, and Toctai, the present sovereign.Having thus recounted the kings of the Western Tartars, I will now describe a great battle fought between Alau, lord of the East, and Barka, lord of the West, with the occasion which led to it.
