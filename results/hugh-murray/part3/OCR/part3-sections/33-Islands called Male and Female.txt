The isle called Male is full 500 miles out at sea, south of Kesmacoran. The people are baptized Christians, attached to the law and customs of the Old Testament ; they are very reserved in their intercourse with their wives. All the latter, indeed, dwell in another isle which is called Female. The men go and reside there three months in the year—March, April, and May—when they return to their own residence, and spend the remaining nine months in labour. In this isle is found very fine and beautifulamber. The people live on rice, milk, and flesh, and excel in fishing, capturing enough both for their own food and for exportation. They have no ruler except a bishop subject to the Archbishop of Scotra, and have languages of their own. The isle where their wives reside is thirty miles distant ; but they could not live if they spent the whole year with them. The sons remain with their mothers till the of fourteen, when they go to join their fathers in their separate abode.
