Baidu, his uncle, and aChristian, then seized the sovereignty, and was generally obeyed, unless by Casan and hisarmy. The latter, on learning these things, regretted much that he had not been able to punish Quiacatu, but determined to take such vengeance on Baidu, that the world might admire it. He marched without delay against that chief, who, informed of his approach, assembled a great force, and marched ten days’ journey to meet him, when he encamped, and awaited his adversary, earnestly exhorting and encouraging his troops. In two days Casan came up, and immediately a battle began, most bloody and desperate ; but it was vain for Baidu to struggle, since, as soon as the contest commenced, many of his men went over and fought on the side of his opponent. He was accordingly discomfited, and killed. Casan, thus victorious, immediately marched to court and assumed the sovereignty, when all the barons paid him homage and obedience ; and this was in the year 1294.* Thus have you heard the whole train of affairs from Abaga down to Casan. You must likewise know that Alau, who conquered Bagdad, and was brother to Kublai, was ancestor to all the princes now named ; for he was the father of Abaga, grandfather of Argon, who was the parent of Casan, now reigning. Having told you all about these Tartars of the East, I might go on to treat of Great Turkey ; but the truth is, I have done so already, mentioning all the acts of Kaidu, so that I have nothing more to say, and shall therefore now tell you of the provinces and people that lie to the northward.
