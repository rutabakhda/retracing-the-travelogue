When a man goes 500 miles southward from Lochac, he finds an island named Pentam, very wild, all covered with odoriferous woods. Thence he navigates between these two islands about sixty miles, drawing only four paces of water, so that large vessels in the passage must remove their: rudder. He then goes on south-east about thirty miles, and reaches an island also named Pentam, with the noble and rich city Malauir, having much traffic in spices and other articles. The people have a king and languages of their own.
