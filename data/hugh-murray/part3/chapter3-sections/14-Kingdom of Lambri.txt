Lambri is a kingdom having a sovereign of its own, who owns the supremacy of the khan. The people are all idolaters ; they have a great abundance of camphor and other spices ; likewise brazil-wood.This they sow, and when it has grown to a little twig, they transplant it to another place, and at the end of three years root it up.We brought some of this seed to Venice, but it did not spring at all on account of the cold. I will tell you another very wonderful thing ; for there are men in this kingdom who have tails like dogs, larger than a palm, and who are covered with hair. They remain in the mountains, never visiting the towns.* There are unicorns, with various beasts and birds for hunting. Now let us depart and tell you of Fansur.
