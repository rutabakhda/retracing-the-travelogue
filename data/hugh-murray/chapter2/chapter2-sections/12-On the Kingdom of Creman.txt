Creman is a kingdom anciently belonging to Persia, and which used to be governed by a hereditary prince ; but since the Tartar conquered it, he appoints what deputy he pleases. In that region the stones called turquoises are in great abundance ; they are found in the mountains, and excavated from the rocks, The inhabitants make all things necessary for troops, such as reins, saddles, bows, arrows, quivers, and all kinds of arms, according to the custom of the country. The ladies work very neatly cloths of gold and silk, representing with the needle, beasts, birds, and many other objects.In the mountains are reared the finest falcons in the world, for though smaller than the peregrine species, they fly so swiftly that no bird can escape them. When a man leaves the city of Creman, he travels seven days through towns and fortified places, finding much amusement, because there are great numbers of wild beasts and birds, At the end of these seven days, he comes to the declivity of a mountain, and continues two days always descending. There are abundance of fruits, but no habitation, only shepherds pasturing their flocks. The cold on this road during winter is so great that a man cannot safely travel unless with a very ample provision of clothes.
