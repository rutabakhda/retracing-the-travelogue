Having now told you of the Old Man of the Mountain and his assassins, you shall hear how he was killed. I had forgot to mention, that he had other old men placed under him, one of whom he sent into the country of Damascus, and the other into Kurdistan. But now let us come to his destruction. It was in 1262 that Alau, the Lord of the East, having heard of his wicked deeds, determined to destroy him. He sent his generals with a great body of men, who besieged the castle full three years, and then could only reduce it by famine. Alaodin being taken, was killed, with all his people, and since that time there has been no assassin ; and thus ended his dominion and his wickedness.
