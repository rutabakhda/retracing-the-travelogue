1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"Now I am to give you a wonderful account of the greatest king of the Tartars, still reigning, named Kublai, or lord of lords."
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"That name is assuredly well merited, since he is the most powerful in people, in lands, and in treasure, that is, or ever was, from the creation of Adam to the present day ; "
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"Whosoever descends in the direct line from Gengis is entitled to be master of all the Tartars, and Kublai is the sixth great khan."
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"He began to reign in the year of our Lord 1256,and maintained the dominion by his valour, address, and wisdom."
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"His brothers sought to oppose his succession, but by bravery and right he triumphed over them."
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"From the beginning of his reign, forty-two years have elapsed to the present day, in the year 1298."
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"He is now full eighty-five years old, and before his accession commanded many armies, when he approved himself good at weapons, and a brave captain."
1,PART 1,1,Power and Magnificence of Kublai,"But since that time he has joined the army only once, which was in the year 1286, and I will tell you on what occasion."
1,PART 1,2,Insurrection raised by Nayan,"You must understand that a certain cousin of his, named Nayan, who, like his ancestors, was his vassal, yet had many lands and provinces of his own, and could raise 400,000 horsemen, being thirty years old,refused to remain longer in subjection, and assumed the whole sovereignty to himself."
1,PART 1,2,Insurrection raised by Nayan,"He sent to a certain great lord, named Kaidu, a nephew of that monarch, but in rebellion against him, and desirous of doing him the greatest injury."
1,PART 1,2,Insurrection raised by Nayan,"To him Nayan proposed to attack the monarch on one side, while he himself advanced on another, so that they might acquire the dominion over his whole territory."
1,PART 1,2,Insurrection raised by Nayan,"Kaidu declared himself well pleased, and promised to be ready at the time appointed."
1,PART 1,2,Insurrection raised by Nayan,"He could bring into the field 100,000 cavalry ; "
,,,,"and those two assembled a mighty army on horseback and foot, and marched against the great khan."
1,PART 1,3,Kublai prepares to meet him,"When Kublai learned these things, he was not at all alarmed, but declared, that he wished he might never wear a crown, nor hold sway over a kingdom, if he did not bring the traitors to an evil death."
1,PART 1,3,Kublai prepares to meet him,"He therefore made his whole army be prepared in twenty-two days, and so secretly, that nothing was known beyond his own council."
1,PART 1,3,Kublai prepares to meet him,"He raised full 360,000 mounted soldiers, and 100,000 infantry ;"
,,,,"and the reason of their number not being greater, was, that they consisted only of his huntsmen, and those immediately round his person, the rest being employed in carrying on distant wars ;"
,,,," for if he could have assembled his whole host, the multitude would have been such as no man could have numbered."
1,PART 1,3,Kublai prepares to meet him,"He then called his astrologers, and asked of them if he would be victorious ; "
,,,,"they answered, that he would do to his enemies according to his pleasure."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"The great khan having assembled these forces, took his departure, and in twenty days came to a vast plain, where Nayan had assembled all his troops, amounting to 400,000 warriors."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"The khan took much care to scour the paths, and intercept all who could have carried the intelligence ; "
,,,,"so that when he approached at dawn of day, the rebel was lying asleep in bed with a favourite wife, not having the least dread of his arrival, and, consequently, no guard on any side of the camp."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"Kublai then advanced, having a tower fixed upon four elephants, whereon were placed his ensigns, so that he could be seen by the whole army."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"His men, divided into bands of twenty thousand, surrounded in a moment the adverse force, each soldier having a footman on the crupper behind him, with a bow in his hand."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"When Nayan and his men saw their camp thus encircled by the khan and his host, they were seized with amaze ; "
,,,,"yet they ran to arms, formed themselves in order of battle, and were soon prepared to strike."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"Then began the beating on many instruments, and singing with loud voices;"
,,,," for it is the custom of the Tartars, that until the horn termed naccar is winded the troops do not engage."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"But when that grand trumpet of the great khan was sounded, all the other performers began playing, and raising their voices very loud, making a noise that was truly most wonderful."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"Then the two armies rushed against each other with sword, spear, and lance, while the footmen were prepared with bow and quiver."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,The battle was fierce and cruel; 
,,,,the arrows filled the air like rain ; 
,,,,horses and horsemen were seen falling to the ground; 
,,,,"and the tumult was such, that if Jove had thundered, he could not have been heard."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"Nayan was a baptized Christian, and therefore had the cross upon his standard."
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"Never, in our day, was there so hard and terrible a combat, nor so many assembled on one field, especially of horsemen ;"
,,,, and the number who fell on both sides was fearful to behold.
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,The battle continued from nine in the morning till midday ; 
,,,,but the great khan at last remained master of the field.
1,PART 1,4,Description of the Battle,"When Nayan and his men saw that they could hold out no longer, they betook themselves to flight ; "
,,,,but it availed them nothing; 
,,,,"he was taken, and all his troops surrendered."
1,PART 1,5,The Death of Nayan,"When that great monarch heard that Nayan was taken, he ordered him to be put to death in the manner I am now to tell you."
1,PART 1,5,The Death of Nayan,"He was wrapped in a carpet, and violently tossed to and fro till he died."
1,PART 1,5,The Death of Nayan,"This mode was adopted, that, being of imperial lineage, his blood might not be shed on the ground, nor his cries ascend into the air."
1,PART 1,5,The Death of Nayan,"When that battle was gained, four of his provinces paid tribute and homage to the great khan."
1,PART 1,5,The Death of Nayan,"These were Cicorcia, Cauli, Bastol, and Suchintin."
1,PART 1,6,Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens,"When themonarch had achieved this triumph, the Saracens, Pagans, Jews, and other generations of men who believe not in God, expressed wonder at the cross which the vanquished leader had carried on his standard, and said in derision of the Christians,-""see how the cross of your God has aided Nayan and his people."""
1,PART 1,6,Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens,"They made such a noise on this subject, that it came to the ears of the prince, who was much displeased, and sending for the Christians, said to them,-""if your God did not assist Nayan, he acted with great justice, because he is a good and righteous God. Nayan was a traitor and rebel against his lord, and therefore God did well in not assisting himù."""
1,PART 1,6,Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens,"Then the Christians replied,-""O, great sire! thou hast spoken the truth, for the cross will aid nothing unjust, and he met only what he well deserved."""
1,PART 1,6,Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens,"Having gained this victory, the great khan returned to his capital, Kambalu, with much festival and rejoicing."
1,PART 1,6,Kublai silences the Mockery of the Jews and Saracens,"When the other king, named Kaidu, heard how his ally had been worsted, he was struck with fear, and did not attempt to lead his army against the monarch."
,,,,"Now you have seen how that prince went to battle,and for what cause, while on all other occasions he sent his son and his barons;"
,,,,but this war was of such magnitude that it seemed to deserve his own immediate presence. 
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"The grand khan, having obtained this splendid victory, returned with great pomp and triumph to his capital of Kambalu."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"He arrived there in November, and remained till after March, in which month our festival of Easter occurred."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"Aware that this was one of our most solemn periods, he commanded all the Christians to attend him, bringing with them their book containing the four gospels."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"He caused it, in a very respectful manner, to be repeatedly perfumed with incense, ordering all his nobles present to do the same."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,Such was the custom upon each of the two great festivals of Easter and Christmas; 
,,,,"and he followed the same course as that pursued by the Saracens, Jews, and idolaters."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"Being asked the reason of this conduct, he replied,-""there are four great prophets revered and worshipped by different classes of mankind. The Christians hold Christ as their divinity ; the Saracens, Mohammed ; the Jews, Moses; and the idolaters, Sogomombar Khan, their most distinguished idol. I honour and respect all the four, and seek aid from them, as any one of them may really be supreme in heavenù."""
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"Yet, from the behaviour of his majesty towards the Christians, he evidently believed their faith the best and truest ; "
,,,,"observing, that it enjoined nothing on its professors that was not full of virtue and holiness."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"He would not indeed allow the cross to be borne before them in processions, because, as he said, on it so exalted a person had been nailed and put to death."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"Some may ask, why if thus partial to the true faith, he did not openly embrace it?"
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"He stated his reason to Nicolo and Maffio Polo, when, on his sending them ambassadors to the Pope, they ventured to address to him a few words on the subject."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,""" Why,ù ""said he, ""should I become a Christian?"""
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"You must yourselves see that the professors of that faith now in this country are ignorant and weak, unable to do any thing extraordinary, while the idolaters have power to do whatever they please."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"While I am seated at table, the cups, filled with wine or other beverage, come to me from the middle of the hall spontaneously, without being touched by any human hand."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"They are able to control bad weather, and force it to retire to any quarter of the heavens; "
,,,,they can perform other wonderful things of the same nature.
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"You have witnessed their idols exercising the faculty of speech, and predicting whatever events are inquired into."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"Should I become a convert and profess Christianity, the nobles of my court, and others disinclined to the faith, will ask what adequate motives have induced me to be baptized."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"What wonders, what miracles, they will say, have its ministers performed?"
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"But the idolaters declare, that their exhibitions are made through their own holiness and the might of their idols."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"To this I shall be unable to make any answer, and be considered as labouring under a grievous mistake, while the heathen teachers, by the profound art which they display, may easily accomplish my death."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"Return, however, to your pontiff, and present to him my request, that he would send a hundred persons learned in your law, who, when confronted with the others, will be able to control them, and while proving themselves endowed with similar skill, shall render their antagonists unable in their presence to carry on these practices."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"On witnessing this, I will interdict the exercise of their religion, and suffer myself to be baptized."
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"This example will be followed by all my nobility, and by my subjects in general ;"
,,,, so that the Christians in these regions will become more numerous than those inhabiting your own countryù.
1,PART 1,7,His Opinions as to the Christian Religion,"From this language it evidently appears that had the pope sent out persons duly qualified to preach the gospel, the great khan would have embraced that faith, for which he certainly entertained a strong predilection."
1,PART 1,8,Rewards bestowed on his Soldiers,"Now let us tell of the officers and barons of the great khan, and how he rewarded those who fought with him in the battle against Nayan."
1,PART 1,8,Rewards bestowed on his Soldiers,"To those who commanded 100 men, he gave the command of 1000, and to those of 1000 that of 10,000 ; "
,,,,"and he bestowed, according to their rank, tablets of gold or of silver, on all of which was written,-""By the might of the great God, and by the favour which he gave to our emperor : may that prince be blessed, and may all those who do not obey him die and be destroyedù."""

1,PART 1,8,Rewards bestowed on his Soldiers,"There are also tablets whereon is sculptured a gerfalcon, which he gives to three great barons, who have then equal authority with himself."
1,PART 1,8,Rewards bestowed on his Soldiers,"They can take, whenever they please, and lead from place to place, the troops and horses of any prince or king; "
,,,,"and whoever dares to disobey in any thing their will and mandate, must die as a rebel to the sovereign."

1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"One of these, a Saracen, named Achmac, had acquired an extraordinary influence with the great khan ; "
,,,,indeed his master was so infatuated with him that he allowed him the most uncontrolled license.
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"It was even discovered after his death that he had employed spells to fascinate the khan, and compel him to give full credit to what was told him by his favourite, who was thus enabled to conduct public affairs according to his pleasure."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He disposed of all the commands and public offices; passed sentence upon offenders; and when desirous to inflict an injury on any one whom he hated, needed only to go to the emperor and say, ""such a man has been guilty of an offence against your majesty, and deserves deathù."""
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"The monarch usually replied, do as you judge best, and Achmac then ordered him to be immediately executed."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"So manifest were the proofs of his influence, and of the sovereign's implicit reliance on his statements, that no one dared to contradict him on any occasion ; "
,,,,even those highest in office stood in awe of him.
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Any one charged by him with a capital offence, whatever means he might employ to justify himself and refute the accusation, could not find an advocate ; "
,,,,for none dared to oppose the purpose of Achmac.
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Thus  he caused unjustly the death of many, and was also enabled to indulge his unlawful propensities."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Whenever he saw a woman who pleased him, he contrived either to add her to the number of his wives, or to lead her into a criminal intimacy."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"On receiving information of any man having a beautiful daughter, he despatched emissaries with instructions to say to him, "" what are your views with regard to this handsome girl? the best thing you can do is to give her to the lord-vice-gerent ;ù """
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"for so they termed Achmac, implying that he was his majesty's representative ; ""we will induce him to appoint you to a certain government or office for three yearsù""."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,The father was thus tempted to give away his child ; 
,,,,"and as soon as the affair was arranged, the other went and informed the emperor that a government was vacant, or would become so on a particular day, and recommended the parent as well qualified to discharge its duties."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,His majesty consented; 
,,,,and the appointment was immediately made.
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Thus, either through ambition to hold high office, or dread of his power, he obtained possession of the fairest females, under the denomination of wives or of concubines."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Besides, he had twenty-five sons, who held the highest offices in the state, and, availing themselves of his authority, were guilty of similar violent and licentious proceedings."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He had likewise accumulated great wealth, since every one who obtained an appointment found it requisite to make him a liberal present."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"During a period of twenty-two years, he exercised this absolute authority."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"At length the Kataians, natives of the country, unable to endure longer his multiplied acts of injustice and violation of domestic rights, began to devise means of bringing about his death and the overthrow of the government."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Among the leading persons in this plot was Chenku, a commander of 6000 men, in whose family his dissolute conduct had spread dishonour."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He proposed the measure to one of his nation, named Vanku, who commanded 10,000 men, and suggested for its execution the period when the great khan, having completed his three months' residence in Kambalu, should have departed for his palace at Shandu, while his son Gengis had also retired to the place usually visited by him at that season."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"The charge of the city was then intrusted to Achmac, who communicated all affairs that occurred during his master's absence, and received the necessary instructions."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Vanku and Chenku, having thus consulted together, imparted the design to some leading persons among the Kataians, and also to their friends in various other cities."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"They formed an agreement, that on a certain day, immediately on perceiving a signal made by fire, they should rise and put to death all persons wearing beards. "
,,,,"This distinction was made because they themselves naturally wanted this appendage, which characterized the Tartars, the Saracens, and the Christians."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"The grand khan, having acquired the sovereignty of Kataia, not by any legitimate right, but solely by force of arms, placed no confidence in the natives, and therefore intrusted ail the provincial governments to Tartars, Saracens, Christians, and other foreigners belonging to his household."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"From this cause his reign was universally detested by the people, who found themselves treated as slaves by the Tartars, and still worse by the Saracens."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Vanku and Chenku, having thus arranged their plans, succeeded at night in entering the palace; "
,,,,"when the former placed himself on one of the royal seats, made the apartment be lighted up, and sent a messenger to Achmac, then residing in the old city."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He professed to come from Gengis, the emperor's son, who, he said, had unexpectedly arrived, and required his immediate attendance."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,The viceroy was much surprised by this intelligence ;

1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"On passing the gate of the new city, he met the Tartar officer named Kogatai, who commanded the guard of 12,000 men, and who asked him whither hewas going at that late hour."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He stated his intention of waiting upon Gengis, whose arrival had just been announced to him."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"""It is very surprising,""ù said the officer, ""how he should have come so secretly that I was not apprized of it, so as to send a party of guards to attend himù."""
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"The two Kataians, meantime, felt confident, that if they could succeed in despatching Achmac, they had nothing farther to fear."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"On entering the palace, and seeing so many lights blazing, he prostrated himself before Vanku, whom he supposed to be the prince, when Chenku, who held a sword ready in his hand, severed his head from his body."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,Kogatai had stopped at the door ; 
,,,,"but, seeing this catastrophe, he exclaimed that treason was at work, and presently discharged an arrow, which slew Vanku as he sat upon the throne."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He then caused his men to seize the other, and despatched an order to the city to kill every one who should be found abroad."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"The Kataians, however, seeing the conspiracy discovered, one of their chiefs killed, and the survivor a prisoner, remained in their houses, and could not make the concerted signals to the other towns."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Kogatai lost no time in sending messengers with a particular relation of these events to the khan, who, in reply, ordered him diligently to investigate the conspiracy, and to punish according to the degree of their guilt those found implicated in it."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Next day, after receiving this command, he examined all the Kataians, and inflicted the punishment of death on the ringleaders."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,Other cities known to have participated in the guilt suffered similar inflictions.
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"When his majesty returned to Kambalu, he inquired eagerly into the cause of this disturbance, and learned that the infamous Achmac and seven of his sons (the others being less culpable) had committed several enormities."
,,,," He gave orders that the treasure, which he had accumulated to an incredible amount, should be removed from his place of residence to the new city, where it was lodged in his own treasury."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"He directed even that his corpse should be disinterred, and thrown into the street, where the dogs might tear it in pieces."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"The sons, who had pursued the same criminal course with their father, were ordered to be flayed alive."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Considering also the principles of the accursed sect of the Saracens, which allow them to indulge in the commission of every crime, and even to murder those who differ from them on points of belief, whence even the detestable Achmac and his sons might have imagined themselves guiltless, he regarded the whole body with contempt and abomination."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,"Summoning them to his presence, he forbade the continuance of many practices enjoined in their law, ordering that in future their marriages should be arranged according to the Tartar custom ; "
,,,,"and that, in killing animals for food, instead of cutting their throats, they should rip open the stomach."
1,PART 1,13,Wicked Administration of Achmac-Insurrection,Marco Polo was on the spot when these events took place.
1,PART 1,14,Guards of the Great Khan,"When the great khan holds a court, he is guarded, on account of his excellency and honour, by 12,000 horsemen, who are called quiesitan, that is, faithful servants of their lord; "
