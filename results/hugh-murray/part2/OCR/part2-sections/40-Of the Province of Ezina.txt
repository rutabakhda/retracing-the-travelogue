After riding twelve days, you come to a city named Ezina,which is at the northern extremity of the desert of sand, and still in Tangut. The people, who are idolaters, breed camels and other beasts, and have falcons of different species and of good quality. They live by the fruits of the earth and cattle, and are also employed in merchandise. In this city, a man lays in provisions for forty days, during which time, travelling from Ezina northwards, there is neither habitation nor inns. But the people, except during summer, remain in the valleys; and in the mountains they find a number of wild beasts, especially asses: there are also pine-forests. At the end of these forty days they reach a northern province, and you shall hear what it is.
