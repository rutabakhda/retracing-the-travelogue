You shall Jearn all about the Old Man of the Mountain, as I Marco heard related by many persons. He was called in their language Alaodin, and had caused to be formed, in a valley between two mountains, the largest and most beautiful garden that ever was seen. There grew all the finest fruits in the world, and it was adorned by the most beautiful houses and palaces, the interior being richly gilded, and furnished with finely coloured pictures of birds and beasts, and the most striking objects. It contained several conduits through which flowed respectively water, wine, honey, and milk. Here were ladies and damsels unequalled in beauty and in the skill with which they sung and played on instruments of every description. Now the Old Man made his people believe that this garden was paradise, and he formed it thus because Mohammed had given the Saracens to believe that those who went into that place would meet great numbers of beautiful women, and find rivers of water, wine, milk, and honey; hence the visiters were led to think that this really was paradise. Into this garden he admitted no man except those whom he wished to make assassins. The entry to the spot was commanded by a castle so strong that he did not fear any power in the world. He kept in his court all the youths of the country between twelve and twenty years of age, and when he thought proper, selected a number who had been well instructed in the description of paradise. He gave them a beverage which threw them into a deep sleep, then carried them into the garden, and made them be awakened. When any one of them opened his eyes, saw this delightful spot, and heard the delicious music and songs, he really believed himself in the state of blessedness. When again, however, he fell asleep, he was brought out into the castle, where he awoke in great wonder, and felt deep regret at having left that delightful abode. He then went humbly to the Old Man, worshipping him as a prophet. Being asked whence he came, he told that he had been in the paradise described by Mohammed, relating all he had seen, and saying that he desired much to die and return thither. The chief then named to him a great lord whom he wished him to kill. The youth cheerfully obeyed, and if in the act he was taken and put to death, he suffered with exultation, believing that he was to go into the happy place. If, after performing the deed, he escaped, the Old Man received him with the greatest honour, and when he wished to destroy another chief, employed him afresh, saying that he was sent into paradise. Thus scarcely any person could escape being slain, when the Old Man of the Mountain desired it; and many barons became vassals to him through the dread of thus losing their lives.
