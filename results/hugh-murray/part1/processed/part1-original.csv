1	part1	1	Power and Magnificence of Kublai	2	That name is assuredly well merited, since he is the most powerful in people, in lands, and in treasure, that is, or ever was, from the creation of Adam to the present day ; and by the statements to be made in this book, every man shall be satisfied that he really is so.
1	part1	1	Power and Magnificence of Kublai	3	Whosoever descends in the direct line from Gengis is entitled to be master of all the Tartars, and Kublai is the sixth great khan.

1	part1	1	Power and Magnificence of Kublai	8	But since that time he has joined the army only once, which was in the year 1286, and I will tell you on what occasion.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	9	He resides in the vast city of Kambalu, three months in the year, December, January, and February, and has here his great palace, which I will now describe.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	10	It is a complete square, a mile long on every side, so that the whole is four miles in circuit ; and in each angle is a very fine edifice, containing bows, arrows, cords, saddles, bridles, and all other implements of war.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	11	In the middle of the wall between these four edifices are others, making altogether eight, filled with stores, and each containing only a single article.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	12	Towards the south are five gates, the middle one very large, never opened nor shut unless when the great khan is to pass through ; while on the other side is one by which all enter in common.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	13	t Within that wall is another, containing eight edifices similarly constructed ; in which is lodged the wardrobe of the sovereign.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	14	These walls enclose the palace of that mighty lord, which is the greatest that ever was seen.

1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	17	The hall is so spacious that 6000 can sit down to banquet ; and the numberof apartmentais incredible.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	18	Theroof is externally painted with red, blue, green, and other colours, and is so varnished that it shines like crystal, and is seen to a great distance around.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	19	It is also very strongly and durably built.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	20	Between the walls are pleasant meadows filled with various living creatures, as white stags, the musk animal, deer, wild goats, ermines, and other beautiful creatures.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	21	The whole enclosure is full of animals, except the path by which men pass.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	22	On the other side, towards the south, is a magnificent lake, whither many kinds of fish are brought and nourished.

1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	24	Towards the north, about a bowshot from the palace, Kublai has constructed a mound, full a hundred paces high and a mile in circuit, all covered with evergreen trees which never shed their leaves.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	25	When he hears of a beautiful tree, he causes it to be dug up, with all the roots and the earth round it, and to be conveyed to him on the backs of elephants, whence the eminence has been made verdant all over, and is called the green mountain.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	26	On the top is a palace, also covered with verdure ; it and the trees are so lovely that all who look upon them feel delight and joy.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	27	In the vicinity is another palace, where resides the grandson of the great khan, Temur, who is to reign after him, and who follows the same life and customs as his grandsire.
1	part1	10	His magnificent Palace in Kambalu	28	He has already a golden bull and the imperial seal ; but he has no authority while his grandfather lives.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	29	Having described to you the palaces, I will tell you of the great city of Cathay, which contains them.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	30	Near it is another large and splendid one, also named Kambalu, which means in our language city of the lord; but the monarch, finding by astrology that this town would rebel, built another near it, divided only by a river, and bearing the same name, to which its inhabitants were compelled to remove.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	31	It forms a regular square, six miles on each side, and thus twenty-four miles in circumference.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	32	It is surrounded by walls of earth, ten paces thick and twenty in height; yet the upper part becomes gradually thinner, so that at top the breadth is only three paces.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	33	There are twelve gates, each containing an edifice, making one in each square of that wall, and filled with men, who guard the place.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	34	The streets are so broad and so straight that from one gate another is visible.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	35	It contains many beautiful houses and palaces, and a very large one in the midst, containing a steeple with a large bell, which at night sounds three times ; after which no man must leave the city without some urgent necessity, as of sickness, or a woman about to beara child.
1	part1	11	Description of the City of Kambalu	36	At each gate a thousand men keep guard, not from dread of any enemy, but in reverence of the monarch who dwells within it, and to prevent injury by robbers.
1	part1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	37	When the monarch comes to his chief city, he remains in his noble palace three days and no more, when he holds a great court, making high festival and Tejoicing with his ladies.
1	part1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	38	There is a vast abundance of people through all the suburbs of Kambalu, which are twelve in number, one corresponding to each gate ; no one can count the number of residents ; and they contain as stately edifices as any in the city, except the king’s Palace.
1	part1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	39	No one is allowed to be buried within the city ; and no females of bad character can reside there, but must have their dwellings in the suburbs, where there are said to be no fewer than 20,000.
1	part1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	40	There are brought also to Kambalu the most costly articles in the world, the finest productions of India, as precious stones and pearls, with all the produce of Cathay and the surrounding countries, in order to supply the lords and the barons and ladies who reside there.
1	part1	12	The Suburbs—Merchants	41	Numerous merchants, likewise, bring more than a thousand wagons laden with grain; and all who are within a hundred miles of the city come thither to purchase what they want.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	42	I will hereafter particularly mention a council of twelve persons, having power to dispose at will of the lands, governments, and all things belonging to the state.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	43	One of these, a Saracen, named Achmac, had acquired an extraordinary influence with the great khan ; indeed his master was so infatuated with him that he allowed him the most uncontrolled license.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	44	It was even discovered after his death that he had employed spells to fascinate the khan, and compel him to give full credit to what was told him by his favourite, who was thus enabled to conduct public affairs according to his pleasure.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	45	He disposed of all the commands and public offices; passed sentence upon offenders; and when desirous to inflict an injury on any one whom he hated, needed only to go to the emperor and say, “such a man has been guilty of an offence against your majesty, and deserves death”.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	46	The monarch usually replied, do as you judge best, and Achmac then ordered him to be immediately executed.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	47	So manifest were the proofs of his influence, and of the sovereign’s implicit reliance on his statements, that no one dared to contradict him on any occasion ; even those highest in office stood in awe of him.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	48	Any one charged by him with a capital offence, whatever means he might employ to justify himself and refute the accusation, could not find an advocate ; for none dared to oppose the purpose of Achmac.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	49	Thus  he caused unjustly the death of many, and was also enabled to indulge his unlawful propensities.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	50	Whenever he saw a woman who pleased him, he contrived either to add her to the number of his wives, or to lead her into a criminal intimacy.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	51	On receiving information of any man having a beautiful daughter, he despatched emissaries with instructions to say to him, “ what are your views with regard to this handsome girl?
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	52	the best thing you can do is to give her to the lord-vicegerent ;” for so they termed Achmac, implying that he was his majesty’s representative ; “we will induce him to appoint you to a certain government or office for three years”.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	53	The father was thus tempted to give away his child ; and as soon as the affair was arranged, the other went and informed the emperor that a government was vacant, or would become so on a particular day, and recommended the parent as well qualified to discharge its duties.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	54	His majesty consented; and the appointment was immediately made.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	55	Thus, either through ambition to hold high office, or dread of his power, he obtained possession of the fairest females, under the denomination of wives or of concubines.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	56	Besides, he had twentyfive sons, who held the highest offices in the state, and, availing themselves of his authority, were guilty of similar violent and licentious proceedings.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	57	He had likewise accumulated great wealth, since every one who obtained an appointment found it requisite to make him a liberal present.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	58	During a period of twenty-two years, he exercised this absolute authority.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	59	At length the Kataians, natives of the country, unable to endure longer his multiplied acts of injustice and violation of domestic rights, began to devise means of bringing about his death and the overthrow of the government.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	60	Among the leading persons in this plot wasChenku, a commander of 6000 men, in whose family his dissolute conduct had spread dishonour.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	61	He proposed the measure to one of his nation, named Vanku, who commanded 10,000 men, and suggested for its execution the period when the great khan, having completed his three months’ residence in Kambalu, should have departed for his palace at Shandu, while his son Gengis had also retired to the place usually visited by him at that season.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	62	The charge of the city was then intrusted.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	63	to Achmac, who communicated all affairs that occurred.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	64	during his master’s absence, and received the necessary instructions.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	65	Vanku and Chenku, having thus consulted together, imparted the design to some leading persons among the Kataians, and also to their friends in various other cities.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	66	They formed an agreement, that on a certain day, immediately on perceiving a signal made by fire, they should rise and put to death all persons wearing beards, This distinction was made because they themselves naturally wanted this appendage, which characterized the Tartars, the Saracens, and the Christians.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	67	The grand khan, having acquired the sovereignty of Kataia, not by any legitimate right, but solely by force of arms, placed no confidence in the natives, and therefore intrusted ail the provincial governments to Tartars, Saracens, Christians, and other foreigners belonging to his household.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	68	From this cause his reign was universally detested by the people, who found themselves treated as slaves by the Tartars, and still worse by the Saracens.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	69	Vanku and Chenku, having thus arranged their plans, succeeded at night in entering the palace; when the former placed himself on one of the royal seats, made the apartment be lighted up, and sent a messenger to Achmac, then residing in the old city.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	70	He professed to come from Gengis, the emperor’s son, who, he said, had unexpectedly arrived, and required his immediate attendance.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	71	The viceroy was much surprised by this intelligence ; but, as he stood in awe of the prince, he presently obeyed.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	72	On passing the gate of the new city, he met the Tartar officer named Kogatai, who commanded the guard of 12,000 men, and who asked him whither he ‘was going at that late hour.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	73	He stated his intention of waiting upon Gengis, whose arrival had just been announced to him.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	74	“It is very surprising,” said the officer, “how he should have come so secretly that I was not apprized of it, 0 as to send a party of guards to attend him”.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	75	The two Kataians, meantime, felt confident, that if they could succeed in despatching Achmac, they had nothing farther to fear.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	76	On entering the palace, and seeing so many lights blazing, he prostrated himself before Vanku, whom he supposed to be the prince, when Chenku, who held a sword ready in his hand, severed his head from his body.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	77	Kogatai had stopped at the door ; but, seeing this catastrophe, he exclaimed that treason was at work, and presently discharged an arrow, which slew Vanku as he sat upon the throne.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	78	He then caused his men to seize the other, and despatched an order to the city to kill every one who should be found abroad.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	79	The Kataians, however, seeing the conspiracy discovered, one of their chiefs killed, and the survivor a prisoner, remained in their houses, and could not make the concerted signals to the other towns.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	80	Kogatai lost no time in sending messengers with a particular relation of these events to the khan, who, in reply, ordered him diligently to investigate the conspiracy, and to punish according to the degree of their guilt those found implicated in it.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	81	Next day, after receiving this command, he examined all the Kataians, and inflicted the punishment of death on the Tingleaders.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	82	Other cities known to have participated in the guilt suffered similar inflictions.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	83	When his majesty returned to Kambalu, he inquired eagerly into the cause of this disturbance, and learned that the infamous Achmac and seven of his sons (the others being less culpable) had committed several enormities, He gave orders that the treasure, which he had accumulated to an incredible amount, should be removed from his place of residence to the new city, where it was lodged in his own treasury.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	84	He directed even that his corpse should be disinterred, and thrown into the street, where the dogs might tear it in pieces.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	85	The sons, who had pursued the same criminal course with their father, were ordered to be flayed alive.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	86	Considering also the principles of the accursed sect of the Saracens, which allow them to indulge in the commission of every crime, and even to murder those who differ from them on points of belief, whence even the detestable Achmac and his sons might have imagined themselves guiltless, he regarded the whole body with contempt and abomination.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	87	Summoning them to his presence, he forbade the continuance of many practices enjoined in their law, ordering that in future their marriages should be arranged according to the Tartar custom ; and that, in killing animals for food, instead of cutting their throats, they should rip open the stomach.
1	part1	13	Wicked Administration of Achmac—Insurrection	88	Marco Polo was on the spot when these events took place.
1	part1	14	Guards of the Great Khan	89	When the great khan holds a court, he is guarded, on account of his excellency and honour, by 12,000 horsemen, who are called quiesitan, that is, faithful servants of their lord; and this he does not from fear but regard to his high dignity.
1	part1	14	Guards of the Great Khan	90	Over these 12,000 are four captains, so that each commands 3000; and they keep guard in turn three days and three nights, eating and drinking at the expense of the prince.
1	part1	14	Guards of the Great Khan	91	Then they go away, and another party comes ; and so they proceed throughout the whole year.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	92	When the khan wishes to celebrate a splendid festival, the tables are so arranged that his is much higher than the others, and he sits on the north, with his face toward the south.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	93	His first wife is seated beside him on the left, while, on the right, are his sons and nephews, and all those of imperial lineage, who are so stationed that their head is on a level with the feet of the monarch.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	94	The barons sit still lower; while the ladies, daughters, and female relations of the khan are placed beneath the queen on the left side, and under them all the wives of the barons ; every class knows the spot where they ought to sit.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	95	The tables are so arranged that the monarch can see all the company, who are very numerous ; and outside of that hall there eat more than 40,000 persons, who have come with presents or remarkable objects from foreign parts, and attend on the days when he holds a court or celebrates a marriage.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	96	In the midst of this hall is a very large vessel of fine gold, containing wine, and on each side two smaller ones, whence the liquor is poured out into flagons, each containing fully enough for eight men ; and one of these is placed between every two guests, who have besides separate cups of gold to drink out of.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	97	This supply of plate is of very great value, and indeed the khan has so many vessels of gold and silver that none without seeing could possibly believe it.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	98	At each door of the great hall, or of any part of the palace occupied by his majesty, stand two officers of gigantic height, holding in their hands staves, to prevent persons who enter from touching the threshold.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	99	If any one chances to commit this offence, they take from him his garment, which he must redeem by a payment, or if they spare his dress, inflict at least a number of blows fixed by authority.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	100	As strangers may not be aware of this prohibition, officers are appointed to warn them of it at the time of introduction.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	101	Since, however, some of the company, on leaving the hall, may be so affected with liquor as to be unable to guard against the accident, it is not then severely punished.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	102	Those who serve the khan at table are great barons, who hold their mouths carefully wrapped in rich towels of silk and gold, that their breath may not blow upon the dishes.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	103	When he begins to drink, all the instruments, which are very numerous, are sounded, and while the cup is in his hand, the barons and others present fall on their knees, and make signs of great humility ; this is done every time he drinks, or when new viands are brought in.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	104	These I shall not attempt to recount, since any one may believe that he will have the greatest variety of beasts and birds, wild and domestic, and of fishes in their season, and in the greatest abundance, prepared most delicately in various modes suitable to his magnificence and dignity.
1	part1	15	The Magnificence of his Festivals	105	Every baron or knight brings his wife, and she sits at table along with the other ladies, When the great sire has eaten, and the tables are removed, a number of jesters, players, and other witty persons perform various pieces, exciting much mirth and pleasure among the company, who then all depart and go to their homes.

1	part1	16	Great Festival at the King’s Birthday	109	Many have these robes adorned with precious stones and pearls, so as to be worth 10,000 golden bezants.
1	part1	16	Great Festival at the King’s Birthday	110	The great khan, twelve times in the year, presents to those barons and knights robes of the same colour with his own; and this is what no lord in the world can do.
1	part1	16	Great Festival at the King’s Birthday	111	On the day of his nativity, all the Tartars from every province of the world, who hold lands under him, celebrate a festival, and bring presents suited to their station.

1	part1	16	Great Festival at the King’s Birthday	115	I will tell you no more of this festival, but of another which they celebrate at the beginning of the year, called the White Feast.
1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	116	The Tartars begin their year in February,when the khan and his people celebrate a feast, where all, both men and women, are clothed in white robes.

1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	118	On that day, all who hold land or any dominion under him, make the most magnificent presents in their power, consisting of gold, silver, pearls, precious stones, and rich white cloths; so that, during the whole year, he may have abundance of treasures, and of the means of enjoying himself.

1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	120	On that day, too, he is gratified with at least 5000 elephants covered with cloths of silk and gold, finely wrought with figures of beasts and birds, and each having on his back a box filled with vessels of gold and silver, and other things necessary for the feast.

1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	122	In the morning of that festal day, before the tables are spread, the kings, generals, counts, astrologers, physicians, falconers, and many other officers and rulers, repair to the hall of the sovereign, and those who are not admitted remain without the palace in a place where the monarch can fully see them.
1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	123	They are in the following order :—Foremost, his sons, nephews, and others of his lineage, then kings, generals, and others according to their rank.
1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	124	As soon as each has taken his place, a great prelate rises and says, with a loud voice, “incline and adore ;” and presently all bend down, strike their foreheads on the earth, and make prayers to their master, adoring him as a god.
1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	125	This they do four times, and then go to an altar, on which is written the name of the great khan, Then, out of a beautiful box, they pour incense on that table in reverence of him, and return to their place ; they next make those rich and valuable presents which I have described.
1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	126	When all these things have been done, and the prince has seen them all, the tables are placed, and they sit down, when the feast is ordered and celebrated in the manner already explained.
1	part1	17	Festival of the New Year	127	Now that I have described to you the joy of the White Feast, I will tell you of a most noble thing done by this monarch ; for he has ordered vestments to be bestowed upon the barons there present.

1	part1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	136	You must understand that a certain cousin of his, named Nayan, who, like his ancestors, was his vassal, yet had many lands and provinces of his own, and could raise 400,000 horsemen, being thirty years old,refused to remain longer in subjection, and assumed the whole sovereignty to himself.
1	part1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	137	He sent to a certain great lord, named Kaidu, a nephew of that monarch, but in rebellion against him, and desirous of doing him the greatest injury.
1	part1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	138	To him Nayan proposed to attack the monarch on one side, while he himself advanced on another, so that they might acquire the dominion over his whole territory.
1	part1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	139	Kaidu declared himself well pleased, and promised to be ready at the time appointed.
1	part1	2	Insurrection raised by Nayan	140	He could bring into the field 100,000 cavalry ; and those two assembled a mighty army on horseback and foot, and marched against the great khan.
1	part1	20	Leopards and other wild Animals kept for Hunting	141	Now let us tell of the beasts which his majesty keeps for hunting.
1	part1	20	Leopards and other wild Animals kept for Hunting	142	Among these are leopards and lynxes, or stag-wolves, well fitted for that purpose.
1	part1	20	Leopards and other wild Animals kept for Hunting	143	He has also many lions larger than those of Babylon, of a beautiful hair and colour, striped lengthways, black, red, and white, and trained to catch stags, wild-oxen, hogs, wild-goats, and asses ; and it is delightful to see one of these chases, where the hunters go out, carrying the lion in a cage, and with him a amall dog.
1	part1	20	Leopards and other wild Animals kept for Hunting	144	They have likewise abundance of eagles, with which they capture hares, foxes, and even wolves; those which are trained to catch these last are very large, and of great weight, so that no wolf can escape them.
1	part1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	145	Now let us speak of the dogs kept by this monarch.
1	part1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	146	He has two barons who are brothers, named Bayam and Migam ; they are called cinuci, that is, the keepers of mastiff dogs, and each commands a party of 10,000 men, one clothed in vermilion, and the other in blue; whenever they go out with the monarch they are dressed in these vestments.
1	part1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	147	In each party there are 2000 of the men, who guide respectively one, two, or more large mastiffs, making altogether a vast multitude.
1	part1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	148	When his majesty goes to hunt, these two brothers attend him on opposite sides, each with 10,000 men and 5000 dogs; and they hunt thus a day’s journey distant from each other, and never pursue any animal which is not captured.
1	part1	21	His numerous Dogs and splendid Hunting Expeditions	149	It is indeed beautiful to see the speed of these dogs and the hunters, for when the prince goes out with his barons, boars and other animals are running on every side, and the dogs pursuing.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	150	When the monarch has remained in Kambalu these three months, he departs and goes southward to the ocean two days’ journey distant.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	151	He leads with him 10,000 falconers, conveying full 5000 gerfalcons, peregrine falcons in abundance, and also many vultures; but do not imagine that these are all kept in one place ; there are 200 here, 300 there, and so on.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	152	The birds caught are mostly presented to the great sire, and when he goes to hunt with his gerfalcons, vultures, and falcons, 10,000 men are ranged, two together, so as to enclose much ground ; these are called toscaor, meaning in our language men who remain on the watch, and each has a call and a hood to invite the birds.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	153	And when any falconer, by order of his majesty, sends forth u falcon, he has no need to follow it, because wherever it may go, it is watched by the men ranged in double order, who can either catch it again, or if necessary afford it succour.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	154	Each of the birds belonging to the sovereign and barons has a tablet of silver on its feet, with its name and that of the owner inscribed, so that wherever caught, it can be returned to him.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	155	If he is unknown, the animal must be carried to a chief named bulangazi, or guardian of things that are lost, who stands with his flag on an elevated spot, and all who have missed any thing go to him and recover it.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	156	Whoever finds a horse, a bird, a sword, or any thing else, and does not carry it to the owner or to this officer, is treated as a robber; thus scarcely any thing is ever lost.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	157	When the monarch goes upon these excursions, he has with him four elephants, and a chamber prepared, covered within with cloth of beaten gold, and outwardly with lions’ skins, where he keeps twelve of his very best gerfalcons, with twelve barons to amuse him by their society.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	158	As the falconers ride by, they call, “Sire, the birds are passing,” when he throws open the chamber, and seeing the object, selects the gerfalcons that please him, and sends them forth against the birds, few of which ever escape.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	159	Lying on his couch, he can view and enjoy the chase.
1	part1	22	Falconry and the Chase after Birds	160	Thus, I think, there is not, and never will be, any lord in the world, who has or can have so much diversion as the great khan.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	161	When this mighty monarch comes to one of his places, named Chaccia, he causes his tents to be pitched, with those of his sons and barons.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	162	These exceed 10,000 in number, and are very beautiful and rich.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	163	That in which he keeps his court is so large that 1000 knights can dwell in it; this is for his nobles and other attendants.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	164	He himself resides in another, looking westward, where those to whom he wishes to speak are introduced ; while there is an interior chamber in which he sleeps.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	165	The two halls have each three fine columns of aromatic wood, and are covered outwardly with beautiful lions’ hides, all striped with black, white, and vermilion, so that water cannot enter.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	166	The inside is lined with skins of ermine and zibelline, of the highest value, especially the latter, of which a robe suitable for a man would be worth 2000 golden bezants, while a common one would be worth 1000.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	167	The Tartars call them royal skins, and they are as large as those of a fawn; the whole hall is covered with them, worked most delicately in intaglio.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	168	These apartments contain furniture of such value that a little king could not purchase them.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	169	Around are large tents for his ladies, and for his gerfalcons and other beasts and birds; for he brings all his train, doctors, astronomers, hunters, and other officials, so that the whole appears a large and crowded city.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	170	He remains there till the feast of the Resurrection, during which time he does nothing but chase cranes, swans, and other birds, when those who catch any bring them to him, and thus the sport is beyond what any one can describe.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	171	No baron, nor lord, nor husbandman, can keep a dog or falcon for twenty days’ journey round his residence ; beyond that distance they may do what they please.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	172	No person, too, of whatever condition, must, from March to October, take any game, but leave them to multiply their kind ; so that hares and stags become so fearless as frequently to come up to men, yet are not taken.
1	part1	23	Magnificent Tents of the Great Khan	173	The great khan then returns to the city of Kambalu by the same road, hawking and sporting.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	174	At Shandu in Tartary, near the western frontier of China, he has built a very large palace of marble and other valuable stones.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	175	The halls are gilded all over and wonderfully beautiful, and a space sixteen miles in circuit is surrounded by a wall, within which are fountains, rivers, and meadows.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	176	Here he finds stags, deer, and wild-goats to give for food to the falcons and gerfalcons, which he keeps in cages, and goes out once a-week to sport with them.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	177	Frequently he rides through that enclosure, having a leopard on the crupper of his horse, which, whenever he is inclined, he lets go, and it catches a stag, deer, or wild-goat, which is given to the gerfalcons in the cage.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	178	In this park, too, the monarch has a large palace framed of cane, the interior gilded all over, having pictures of beasts and birds most skilfully worked on it.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	179	The roof is of the same material, and so richly varnished that no water can penetrate.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	180	I assure you these canes are more than three palms thick, and from ten to fifteen paceslong.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	181	They are cut lengthways, from onc knot to the other, and then arranged so as to form the roof.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	182	The whole structure is so disposed that the khan, when he pleases, can order it to be taken down, for it is supported by more than 200 cords of silk.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	183	His majesty remains there three months of the year, June, July, and August, the situation being cool and agreeable ; and during this period his palace of cane is set up, while all the rest of the year it is down.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	184	On the 28th of August, he departs thence, and for the following purpose :—There are a race of mares white as snow, with no mixture of any other colour, and in number 10,000, whose milk must not be drunk by any one who is not of imperial lineage.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	185	Only one other race of men can drink it, called Boriat, because they gained a victory for Gengis Khan.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	186	When one of these white animals is passing, the Tartars pay respect to it as to a great lord, standing by to make way for it.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	187	The astrologers and idolaters, too, have told the khan, that on the 28th August this milk must be sprinkled through the air, and over the earth, that the spirits may drink plentifully, and may preserve all that belong to him, men, women, beasts, birds, and other things.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	188	But there is a wonderful circumstance that I had forgotten.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	189	When the monarch remained in that palace, and there came on rain, fog, or any bad weather, he had skilful astronomers and enchanters, who made these mischiefs fly away from his palace, so that none of them could approach it.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	190	These wise men are called Tebet and Quesmur ;they are idolaters, and more skilful in diabolical arts and enchantments than any other generation; and though they do it by the art of the devil, they make other men believe that it is through their great sanctity and by the power of God.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	191	t I must tell you, too, another of their customs, that when any man is judged and condemned to death by his lord, they cook and eat him, but not when he dies a natural death.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	192	t I will tell you, too, a great wonder which these bakst do by their enchantments.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	193	When the monarch sits at table in his hall of state, and the cups are ten paces distant, full of wine, milk, and other beverages, they cause them, by their magical spells, to rise from the pavement and place themselves before the prince, without any one touching them ; this is done in the presence of 10,000 men ; and the fact is real and true, without any lie.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	194	These baksi, when the festivals of their idols come round, go to his majesty and say, “ Great sire, you know the feast of such an idol approaches, and are aware that he can cause bad weather and much mischief to your cattle and grain.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	195	We pray, therefore, that you will give us all the sheep with black heads, also incense, aloe-wood, and such and such other things”.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	196	This they tell to the barons, who repeat it to the khan, and he gives what they demand.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	197	Then they goto the image and raise in his presence a delicious fragrance, with incense and spices, cook the flesh, and place it with bread before him.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	198	Thus every god has his day of commemoration in the same manner as our saints.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	199	They have also extensive abbeys and monasteries, one of which here resembles a little city, containing upwards of 2000 monks, who are clothed in a particular dress, which is handsomer than that of other men.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	200	They worship their idols by the grandest feasts, songs, and lights that ever were seen.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	201	And I may tell you that many of these baksi, according to their order, may take wives, do so, and have a number of children.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	202	Yet there is another kind of religious men called sensi, who observe strict abstinence ; they eat nothing but the husks of corn boiled in warm water, fast often in the course of the year, have many large idols, and sometimes adore fire.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	203	Their observances differ from those of every other sect ; they would not take a wife for any thing in the world.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	204	They shave the head and beard, wear black and blue dresses of coarse canvass, sleep upon mats, and lead the hardest life of any men on earth.
1	part1	24	Hunting Palace at Shandu in Tartary	205	Their monasteries and their idols all bear the names of women.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	206	At Cianganor, too, three days’ journey distant, the khan has a large palace, where he is fond of residing, because there are many lakes and rivers, as well as fine plains, abounding in cranes, pheasants, partridges, and other birds.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	207	Here, therefore, he has delightful hawking, and abundant exercise for his falcons and gerfalcons.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	208	There are five kinds of cranes which I must describe.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	209	The first are black like crows, and very large.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	210	The second are white, and very beautiful, for all the feathers are full of round eyes, like those of the peacock, and glitter like gold.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	211	The head is white, black, and red all round, and they are larger than any of the others.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	212	The third species resemble ours.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	213	The fourth are small, and have in their ears very magnificent red and black feathers.
1	part1	25	Palace at Cianganor	214	The fifth are all gray, with handsome red and black heads, and are very large.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	215	With regard to the money of Kambalu, the great khan may be called a perfect alchymist, for he makes it himself.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	216	He orders people to collect the bark of a certain tree, whose leaves are eaten by the worms that spin silk.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	217	The thin rind between the bark and the interior wood is taken, and from it cards are formed like those of paper, all black.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	218	He then causes them to be cut into pieces, and each is declared worth respectively half a livre, a whole one, asilver grosso of Venice, and so on to the value of ten bezants.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	219	All these cards are stamped with his seal, and so many are fabricated, that they would buy all the treasuries in the world.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	220	He makes all his payments in them, and circulates them through the kingdoms and provinces over which he holds dominion ; and none dares to refuse them under pain of death.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	221	All the nations under his sway receive and pay this money for their merchandise, gold, silver, precious stones, and whatever they transport, buy, or sell, The merchants often bring to him goods worth 400,000 bezants, and he pays them all in these cards, which they willingly accept, because they can make purchases with them throughout the whole empire.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	222	He frequently commands those who have gold, silver, cloths of silk and gold, or other precious commodities, to bring them to him.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	223	Then he calls twelve men skilful in these matters, and commands them to look at the articles, and fix their price.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	224	Whatever they name is paid in these cards, which the merchant cordially receives.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	225	In this manner the great sire possesses all the gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones in his dominions.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	226	When any of the cards are torn or spoiled, the owner carries them to the place whence they were issued, and receives fresh ones, with a deduction of 3 per cent.
1	part1	26	Paper Money—Immense Wealth of the Great Khan	227	If a man wishes gold or silver to make plate, girdles, or other ornaments, he goes to the office, carrying a sufficient number of cards, and gives them in payment for the quantity which he requires, This is the reason why the khan has more treasure than any other lord in the world; nay, all the princes in the world together have not an equal amount.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	228	He has appointed twelve very great barons, who hold command over all things in the thirty-four provinces.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	229	They reside in a palace within the city of Kambalu, large and beautiful, containing many halls and apartments ; and for every province there is an agent and a number of writers or notaries, having each a house to himself.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	230	They manage all the provincial affairs according to the will and pleasure of the twelve barons.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	231	The latter have power to appoint the lords of the provinces above mentioned ; and having chosen the one whom they judge best qualified, they name him to the great khan, who confirms him, and bestows a golden tablet corresponding to his command.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	232	These twelve barons are called in the Tartar language scieng, that is, the greater officers of state.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	233	They order the army to go where and in what numbers they please, but all according to the commands of the great sire ; and they do every other thing necessary for the provinces.
1	part1	27	The Twelve Governors of Provinces and their Duty	234	The palace in which they dwell is called scien, and is the largest in all the court; they have the power of doing much good to any one whom they favour.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	235	I must now inform you, that from the city of Kambalu, many messengers are sent to divers provinces, and on all the roads they find, at every twenty-five miles, a post called jamb, where the imperial envoys are received.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	236	At each is a large edifice, containing a bed covered with silk, and every thing useful and convenient for a traveller ; so that ifa king were to come, he would be well accommodated.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	237	Here, too, they find full 400 horses whom the prince has ordered to be always in waiting to convey them when sent into any quarter, along the principal roads.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	238	When they have to go through any district where there is no habitation, the monarch has caused such edifices to be reared at the distance of thirty-five or at most forty miles; thus they go through all the provinces, finding every where inns and horses for their reception.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	239	This is the greatest establishment that ever was kept by any king or emperor in the world ; for at those places there are maintained more than 200,000 horses.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	240	Also the edifices, furnished and prepared in the manner now described, amount to more than 10,000.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	241	Moreover, in the intervals between these stations, at every three miles, are erected villages of about forty houses, inhabited by foot-runners, also employed on these despatches, They wear a large girdle, set round with bells, which are heard at a great distance.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	242	‘When one of them receives a letter or packet, he runs full speed to the next village, where his approach being announced by the bells, another is ready to start and proceed to the next, and soon.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	243	By these pedestrian messengers the khan receives news in one day and night from places distant ten days’ journey; in two, from those distant twenty ; and in ten, from those distant a hundred.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	244	t From them he exacts no tribute, but gives them horses and many other things.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	245	When his messengers go on horseback to carry intelligence into the provinces or bring tidings from distant parts, and, more especially, respecting any district that has rebelled, they ride in one day and night 200, 260, or even 300 miles ; and when there are two, they receive two good horses, bind themselves round the head and body, and gallop fall speed from one station to the next at twentyfive miles’ distance, where they find two others fresh and ready harnessed, on which they proceed with the same rapidity.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	246	They stop not for an instant day nor night, and are thus enabled to bring news in so short a period.
1	part1	28	The Couriers of the Great Khan and their Stations	247	Now, I will tell you the great bounty which the monarch bestows twice in the year.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	248	He sends his messengers through all his kingdoms and provinces, to know if any of his subjects have had their crops injured through bad weather or any other disaster ; and if such injury has happened, he does not exact from them any tribute for that season or year ; nay, he gives them corn out of his own stores to subsist upon, and to sow their fields.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	249	This he does in summer ; in winter he inquires if there has been a mortality among the cattle, and in that case grants similar exemption and aid.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	250	When there is a great abundance of grain, he causes magazines to be formed, to contain wheat, rice, millet, or barley, and care to be taken that it be not lost or spoiled ; then when a scarcity occurs, this grain is drawn forth, and sold for a third or fourth of the current price.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	251	Thus there cannot be any severe famine ; for he does it through all his dominions; he bestows also great charity on many poor families in Kambalu ; and when he hears of individuals who have not food to eat, he causes grain to be given tothem.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	252	Bread is not refused at the court throughout the whole year to any who come to beg for it; and on this account he is adored as a god by his people.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	253	His majesty provides them also with raiment out of his tithes of wool, silk, and hemp.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	254	These materials he causes to be woven into different sorts of cloth, in a house erected for that purpose, where every artisan is obliged to work one day in the week for his service.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	255	Garments made of the stuffs thus manufactured are given to destitute families for their winter and summer dresses, A dress is also prepared for his armies ; and in every city a quantity of woollen cloth is woven, being defrayed from the tithes there levied.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	256	It must be observed, that the Tartars, according to their original customs, when they had not yet adopted the religion of the idolaters, never bestowed alms ; but when applied to by any necessitous person, repelled him with reproachful expressions, saying,— begone with your complaints of a bad season, God has sent it to you, and had he loved you, as he evidently loves me, you would have similarly prospered.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	257	But since some of the wise men among the idolaters, especially the baksi, have represented to his majesty, that to provide for the poor is a good work and highly grateful to their deities, he has bestowed charity in the manner now described, so that, at his court, none are denied food who come to ask for it.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	258	He has also so arranged that in all the highways by which messengers, merchants, and other persons travel, trees are planted at short distances on both sides of the road, and are so tall that they can be seen from a great distance.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	259	They serve thus both to show the way and afford a grateful shade.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	260	This is done whenever the nature of the soil admits of plantation ; but when the route lies through sandy deserts or over rocky mountains, he has ordered stones to be set up, or columns erected, to guide the traveller.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	261	Officers of rank are appointed, whose duty it is to take care that these matters be properly arranged, and the roads kept constantly in good order.
1	part1	29	The Care and Bounty of the Monarch towards his Subjects	262	Besides other motives, the great khan is influenced by the declaration of his soothsayers and astrologers, that those who plant trees receive long life as their reward.

1	part1	42	The Province and City of Sin-din-fu	399	The inhabitants are all idolaters ; and from that city a man goes five days’ journey through castles, villages, and scattered houses.
1	part1	42	The Province and City of Sin-din-fu	400	The people subsist by agriculture, and the tract abounds with wild beasts.
1	part1	42	The Province and City of Sin-din-fu	401	There are also large manufactures of gauzes and cloth of gold.
1	part1	42	The Province and City of Sin-din-fu	402	After travelling these five days, he comes to Thibet.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	403	This is a very large province; the men have a language of their own, and are idolaters.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	404	They border upon Manji and many other countries, and are very great robbers ; the extent is such, that it contains eight kingdoms and many cities and castles.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	405	There are also extensive rivers, lakes, and mountains, where is found a vast quantity of gold.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	406	Cinnamon and coral occur, which last is very dear, because they place it round the neck of their women and their idols, and hold it asa precious jewel.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	407	Here are made camlets, and other cloths of silk and gold.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	408	There are very skilful enchanters and astrologers, but extremely wicked men, who perform works of the devil, which it were unlawful to relate, they would strike with such amazement.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	409	They have mastiff dogs as largeas asses, and excellent in taking wild animals.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	410	This province was entirely destroyed by Mangou, the fifth great khan, in his wars; and its many villages and castles are all demolished.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	411	Here grow large canes, fifteen paces long and four palms thick, while from one knot to the other is full three palms.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	412	The merchants and travellers, who pass through that country in the night, take these canes and set them on fire, when they make such a loud crackling noise that lions, bears, and other destructive animals are terrified, and dare not approach.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	413	They also split them in the middle, and produce thus so mighty a sound, that it would be heard in the night at the distance of five miles ; and the explosion is so alarming, that horses unaccustomed to it often break their reins and harness, and take to flight.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	414	For this reason, travellers, riding such horses, bind them by the feet, and stop their eyes and ears.
1	part1	43	The Province of Thibet	415	A man travels twenty days through these countries without finding either inns or victuals; he must therefore carry with him food for himself and his cattle during the whole of that space, meeting always, too, ferocious wild beasts, which are very dangerous.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	416	The traveller then comes to a part of Thibet where there are houses and castles; but the people have a bad custom.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	417	None of them for the whole world will marry a virtuous maiden, saying that she is worth nothing without having had many lovers.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	418	When strangers, therefore, pass through, and have pitched their tents, or taken their lodging in inns, the old women bring their daughters, often to the number of thirty or forty, and offer them as wives during their stay ; but they must not carry them thence, either back or forward.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	419	When the merchant is about to depart, he gives to the lady some toy or jewel as a testimony that she has lived with him.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	420	These jewels she hangs to her neck, and is anxious to have at least twenty ; for the more she can show, the higher is she valued, and the more readily obtains a husband.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	421	After being married, she is strictly watched, and any infidelity is deeply resented.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	422	These people are idolatrous and wicked, not holding it sinful to commit wrong and robbery ; in short, they are the greatest thieves in the world.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	423	They live on the fruits of the earth, but mostly by hunting and falconry ; and the country contains many of those animals which produce musk, and are called in the Tartar language gudderi.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	424	That sinful people have many good dogs,which they employ in the pursuit of wild animals.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	425	They have neither the cards nor money circulated by the great khan, but make money of salt.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	426	They are poorly clad with the skins of beasts, canvass, and buckram ; they have a language of their own, which they call Tebet.
1	part1	44	Another Part of Thibet	427	Now I will tell you of Kain-du.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	428	This is a province lying to the west, having only one king, the inhabitants idolaters, and subject to the great khan.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	429	It contains a number of cities and castles, with a lake, in which are found many pearls; but the monarch forbids them, under a severe penalty, to be removed except for his own use ; because, if any one were allowed to take them, they would become worth almost nothing.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	430	There is also a mountain, whence are quarried turquoise stones in great abundance, very large and beautiful ; but he does not allow them to be removed unless by his mandate.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	431	In this province they have a strange and base custom, that a man thinks there is no disgrace in an improper intimacy between his wife or sister and a stranger or other person.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	432	On the contrary, when such a one comes to reside in his house, the master presently goes out, and leaves him with his wife.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	433	The visiter remains often three days, and places a hat or something else at the window as a signal; and the husband never returns till he sees this taken away.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	434	This is said to be done in honour of their'idols, who on that account bestow on them many blessings.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	435	Their gold is in small rods,—the value being determined according to the weight, and not marked by any stamp.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	436	The small money is thus made: they take salt, form it into a shape, so that it weighs about halfa pound, and eighty of these are worth a rod of gold.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	437	They have a very great number of the animals which yield the musk ; likewise fishes from the same lake whence the pearls are drawn ; also the usual kinds of wild birds and beasts.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	438	No wine is obtained from vines, but it is made from grain or rice with many spices, which makes a good liquor.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	439	In that province also growsa tree called garofol; it is small, with leaves like a laurel, but longer and narrower ; it bears a small white flower.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	440	It yields ginger, cinnamon, and other spices, which come into our country ; but I have now said to you enough of Kain-du.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	441	After travelling ten days you come toa river which bounds it, named Brius.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	442	In it is found a great quantity of gold dust ; and on its banks abundance of cinnamon ; it flows on to the ocean.
1	part1	45	The Province of Kain-du	443	Now let us tell you of Caraian.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	444	When a man has departed and crossed the river, he enters this province, which is large, and contains seven kingdoms extending westward.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	445	The people are all idolaters, and under the dominion of the great khan.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	446	The king is a son of his, named Essetemur, and is great, rich, and powerful.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	447	He is also brave and upright, ruling his country with much justice.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	448	When the traveller has crossed the river, he passes, during a journey of five days, through a country where there is abundance of cities and castles, with many very good horses ; and the people are supported by cattle and the produce of land.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	449	Their language is extremely difficult to understand.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	450	At the end of these five days, he comes to the capital of the country, named Yaci,t which is particularly great and noble, with many merchants and numerous arts.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	451	There are here various sects, Saracens, idolaters, and Nestorian Christians.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	452	There is a good deal of grain and rice, yet the country is not very fertile.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	453	They make a drink of the latter which intoxicates like wine.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	454	Money is formed of porcelain, such as is found in the sea,and eighty pieces are worth one bar of gold, or eight of silver.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	455	They have pits whence they draw vast quantities of salt, from which the king derives a great revenue.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	456	t Adultery is not considered as a crime, unless when accompanied with violence.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	457	There isa lake here extending a hundred miles, and containing many large fishes, the best in the world.
1	part1	46	The Province of Caraian	458	They use the raw flesh of all fowls and beasts ; for the poor people go to the market and get it newly taken from the animal, put it in garlic sauce, then eat it; the rich likewise eat it raw, but previously cut into small pieces, and the sauce mixed with good spices.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	459	When a man leaves Yaci, or Chiaci, and goes ten days westward, he finds the province of Karazan, with a capital of the same name.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	460	The people are all idolaters, and subject to the great khan; the king is a son of that monarch, named Kogatin.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	461	Gold dust is found in the river, and on the mountains in large pieces so abundantly that a bar is given for six of silver.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	462	The porcelain, too, formerly described circulates for money, but is procured from India, Here are snakes and serpents so huge as to strike all men with astonishment; they are ten paces long, ten palms broad, and have no feet, but only a hoof like that of the lion; the nose is like a loaf of bread, the mouth so huge that it would swallow at once a man whole; the teeth are immense, nor is there any wild beast whom they do not strike with terror.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	463	There are smaller ones eight paces long and six palms broad.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	464	The mode of catching them is this :—They remain during the day in great caverns under the earth, to avoid the heat, but at night go out to feed, and seize all the animals whom they can reach; they also seek drink at the rivers, fountains, and lakes, and then make a deep track in the sand, as if a barrel had been dragged through it.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	465	In it the people fix a stake, fasten to it a steel instrument sharpened like a razor, and cover it over with sand.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	466	When the serpent comes through the track, and strikes against the steel, he is pierced with such violence, that his body is divided from one side to the other, as high as the umbilical cord, and he presently dies.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	467	They then take the body and extract the gall-bladder, which they sell very dear, being an excellent medicine for the bite of a mad dog, when administered in small dozes.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	468	It is also valuable in childbirth, and when given to the woman, a safe delivery immmediately follows.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	469	The flesh also is sold at a high price, being considered delicate food.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	470	The serpent also enters the dens of lions, bears, and other fierce animals, and devours their whelps, when he can get at them.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	471	Here, too, are very large horses, which are carried into India to be sold.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	472	They cut two or three nerves from the tail, so that they may not strike with it the man who rides, which is considered disgraceful.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	473	These people ride like the French, with long staffs, have arms covered with buffalo hide, and carry lances, spears, and poisoned arrows.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	474	Before the great khan conquered them they had a wicked custom, that when any stranger came to lodge with them who was agreeable, wise, and opulent, they killed him during the night by poison or some other mode.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	475	This was not out of enmity or with the view of taking his money, but because they imagined that his wisdom and other good qualities would thus remain with them.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	476	However, about thirty-five years ago, after that monarch conquered the country, he prohibited this crime, which, from fear of him, they no longer commit.
1	part1	47	The Province of Karazan and its great Serpents	477	Now let us tell of another province called Kardandan.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	478	When a man departs from Karazan, and travels to the westward, he enters a province named Kardandan, inhabited by idolaters, and subject to the great khan.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	479	The chief city is called Vociam.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	480	All the people have their teeth, both upper and lower, covered with gold, which thus appear to be made of that metal.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	481	The men are soldiers, and regard nothing but war; the women, with the slaves, perform all the work.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	482	When any lady has been delivered of a boy, the husband goes to bed, taking the child with him, and remains there forty days.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	483	He thus allows rest to the mother, who is only obliged to suckle the infant.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	484	All his friends then come and make a festival, when the wife rises, manages the domestic affairs, and serves her husband, still lying in hed.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	485	They eat all kinds of flesh, both raw and cooked, and rice dressed along with it, and make a very good wine of rice and spices.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	486	They have money of gold and porcelain, and give a bar of gold for five of silver, having no mines of the latter metal within five days’ distance ; by this exchange the merchants make great profit.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	487	This people have neither idols nor churches, but adore the master of the house, and say of him, “we are his; and he is our god”.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	488	They have neither letters nor writing, which is not wonderful, because they live in an unfrequented place, that cannot be visited in the summer on account of the air, which is then so corrupted and pestilent that no foreigner can live there.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	489	Whenever they have dealings together, they select a piece of timber, square or round, cleave it in the middle, and each takes a half; this must be done before two, three, or four witnesses.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	490	When the payment comes to be made, the one receives the money and gives his half of the wood.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	491	In all those provinces there is no physician, but when any one is sick, doctors and exorcists of evil spirits are sent for, who, on coming to the patient, begin their incantations, beating instruments, singing and dancing.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	492	Ina short time one of them falls to the ground, foams at the mouth, and becomes half-dead, when the devil enters into his body.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	493	The other magicians then ask the half-dead man what is the cause of the patient’s illness.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	494	The demon answers from his mouth that the sufferer has given displeasure to such or such a spirit, who is therefore tormenting him.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	495	They then say, “ we beseech you to pardon him, and take in compensation for his blood the presents which we now exhibit,” Then if the sick man is to die, the fiend in the body of the magician says, — the spirit has been wronged and displeased to such a degree, that he will not spare him for any thing in the world”.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	496	If on the contrary a cure is to take place, the devil from the body says, “ take so many sheep and so many dishes of rich pottage, and make a sacrifice of them to the angry spirit”.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	497	The relations of the patient do every thing thus ordered, killing the sheep, sprinkling the blood, and preparing the dishes of pottage.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	498	A great assemblage is made of men and women, who hold a joyous feast, dancing and singing songs in praise of the spirit.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	499	They burn incense and myrrh, with which they fumigate and illuminate the whole house.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	500	When they have acted thus for about an hour, the first magician again falls down, and they inquire if the sick man is now pardoned and will be cured.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	501	It is then answered that he is not yet pardoned, but something more must be done, after which forgiveness will be granted.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	502	This order is obeyed, when he says, “ he is pardoned, and will be immediately cured”.
1	part1	48	The Province of Kardandan	503	The company then exclaim, “ the spirit is on our side,” and having eaten the sheep and drunk the pottage with great joy and festivity, they return to their homes.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	504	Now I must mention a very great battle which was fought in the kingdom of Vociam, and you shall hear all how it happened.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	505	In the year of our Lord 1272, the great khan sent a mighty captain, named Nescardin, with 12,000 men, to defend the province of Caraian.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	506	He was a prudent man, very strong in arms and skilful in war ; and the soldiers with him were good and very brave warriors.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	507	Now the King of Mien and of Bangalat were afraid lest he should invade their territory ; yet they thought they were able to overcome and destroy the whole army in such a manner that the great khan might never feel inclined to send another into the same quarter.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	508	They assembled, therefore, 60,000 horse and foot, with 2000 elephants, each of which had on its back a castle well fortified and defended by twelve, fourteen, or sixteen men.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	509	The King of Mien came with the above army to the city of Vociam, where was the array of the Tartars, and took post in a plain at the distance of three days’ journey.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	510	Nescardin was somewhat alarmed, considering how small a force he had in comparison with the host of the King of Mien; but he took courage, reflecting that his troops were brave and most valiant warriors.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	511	He therefore marched to meet them in the plain of Vociam, and pitched his camp near a great forest, filled with lofty trees, into which he was aware that elephants could not enter.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	512	The King of Mien, seeing the army of Nescardin, advanced to attack it.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	513	The Tartars went with great boldness to meet them, but when their horses saw the elephants with the wooden castles upon them, stationed and arranged in the first line, they were struck with such terror that the riders could not, either by force or any contrivance, make them approach.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	514	They, therefore, immediately alighted, and tied them to the trees, when the infantry returned to the line of elephants, and began to discharge their arrows with the utmost violence.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	515	Those who were on the backs of the animals fought bravely; but the Tartars were stronger, and more accustomed to battle.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	516	They wounded very severely with these missiles a multitude of the elephants, which, being terrified, took to flight and rushed with violence into the adjacent wood.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	517	As they could not be restrained from entering, and rushing backward and forward through the thick trees in confusion, they broke the wooden castles on their backs, and destroyed all their equipments.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	518	When the Tartars saw these animals disposed of, they ran to their horses, which were bound to the trees, mounted them, and rushed upon the warriors of the King of Mien.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	519	They began the attack with a shower of arrows, but as the king and his troops still defended themselves valiantly, they drew their swords, and rushed into close combat.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	520	Now mighty blows were struck ; swords and spears were fiercely thrust on both sides ; heads, arms, and hands were struck off ; and many warriors fell to the earth dead and dying.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	521	The noise and cries would have drowned the loudest thunder.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	522	At length, after midday, the host of Mien gave way; and the king, with all who survived the battle, took to flight, pursued by the Tartars, who killed many of the fugitives.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	523	When satisfied with pursuit, they returned to the wood to catch the elephants.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	524	They endeavoured to stop the flight of these animals by cutting down the trees and laying them across; yet they are so intelligent, that the soldiers would not have succeeded but for the aid of some of the captives taken in battle, through whose means they were able to recover two hundred.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	525	From this time the great khan began to employ elephants in his army, which he had not hitherto done.
1	part1	49	Of the great Battle fought between the Tartars and the King of Mien	526	Afterwards that monarch conquered the lands of Mien, and added them to his dominion.
1	part1	5	The Death of Nayan	527	When that great monarch heard that Nayan was taken, he ordered him to be put to death in the manner I am now to tell you.
1	part1	5	The Death of Nayan	528	He was wrapped ina carpet, and violently tossed to and fro till he died.
1	part1	5	The Death of Nayan	529	This mode was adopted, that, being of imperial lineage, his blood might not be shed on the ground, nor his cries ascend into the air.
1	part1	5	The Death of Nayan	530	When that battle was gained, four of his provinces paid tribute and homage to the great khan.
1	part1	5	The Death of Nayan	531	These were Cicorcia, Cauli, Bastol, and Suchintin.
1	part1	50	Of the great Descent	532	When you have departed from the said province of Curaian, there begins a great descent, which continues for two days and a half;t and in all this journey nothing occurs worthy of notice, except that there is a great space in which a market is held on certain days of the year.
1	part1	50	Of the great Descent	533	Thither come many merchants from divers countries and districts, some of whom bring gold and silver to exchange ; and they give an ounce of the former for five of the latter.
1	part1	50	Of the great Descent	534	None but those who bring the gold can penetrate into the countries where it is produced, so difficult and intricate are the roads, ‘When a man has travelled these two days and a half, he comes to a district which is called Anniz, on the borders of India, towards the south, and then he goes for fifteen days through a region covered with woods filled with elephants, unicorns, and other savage beasts, but not containing any human habitation.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	535	At the termination of these wild and pathless tracts is a large and noble city called Mien, the capital of the province.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	536	The people are all idolaters, with a language peculiar to themselves, and are subject to the great khan.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	537	About this city I will tell you a thing very remarkable.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	538	There was anciently in it a rich and powerful king, who, being about to die, commanded that on his tomb should be erected two towers, one of gold, and the other of silver.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	539	They are full ten paces high, and of a suitable thickness ; the first, being composed of stone, is covered all over with gold to the thickness of a finger, so that to the spectator it appears wholly of that metal.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	540	The summit is round, and filled with little golden bells, which the wind, whenever it strikes them, causes to ring.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	541	The other tower is similarly formed, but is coated with silver, and has silver bells.
1	part1	51	Of the City of Mien, and the most beautiful Tomb of the the King	542	By these buildings the king intentled to display his greatness and dignity, and they are the most beautiful and valuable to be seen in the world.

1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	690	This city held out three years after all the rest of the province had yielded to the conqueror, who besieged it with a mighty army ; but he could approach it only on the side which lies to the north, because it was elsewhere surrounded by a large and deep lake, by which the besieged obtained abundance of provisions, The army was therefore about to abandon the siege in much grief and wrath, and this news was just brought to the khan, when Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco Polo said, —‘ we shall find a way by which the city shall be made to surrender”.
1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	691	The monarch, who was most eagerly bent on its capture, readily listened.

1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	698	When the inhabitants saw a calamity such as they had never witnessed before, they knew not what to think or say.
1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	699	They met in council, and concluded that they must be all killed, unless they submitted.
1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	700	They therefore intimated to the lord of the host that they would surrender on the same terms that others had done.
1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	701	This was agreed to, and Sa-yan-fu came under the power of the great khan, through the interposition of Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco ; and it was not a small service, for this town and province are among the best in his possession, and he draws from them a great revenue.
1	part1	68	Of the City of Sa-yan-fu, and how it was taken	702	Now, we shall leave this subject and treat of a city called Sin-gui.

1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	711	The grand khan, having obtained this splendid victory, returned with great pomp and triumph to his capital of Kambalu.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	712	He arrived there in November, and remained till after March, in which month our festival of Easter occurred.

1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	714	He caused it, in a very respectful manner, to be repeatedly perfumed with incense, ordering all his nobles present to do the same.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	715	Such was the custom upon each of the two great festivals of Easter and Christmas; and he followed the same course as that pursued by the Saracens, Jews, and idolaters.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	716	Being asked the reason of this conduct, he replied,— “there are four great prophets revered and worshipped by different classes of mankind.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	717	The Christians hold Christ as their divinity ; the Saracens, Mohammed ; the Jews, Moses; and the idolaters, Sogomombar Khan, their most distinguished idol.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	718	I honour and respect all the four, and seek aid from them, as any one of them may really be supreme in heaven”.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	719	Yet, from the behaviour of his majesty towards the Christians, he evidently believed their faith the best and truest ; observing, that it enjoined nothing on its professors that was not full of virtue and holiness.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	720	He would not indeed allow the cross to be borne before them in processions, because, as he said, on it so exalted a person had been nailed and put to death.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	721	Some may ask, why if thus partial to the true faith, he did not openly embrace it?
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	722	He stated his reason to Nicolo and Maffio Polo, when, on his sending them ambassadors to the Pope, they ventured to address to him a few words on the subject.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	723	“ Why,” said he, “should I become a Christian?
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	724	You must yourselves see that the professors of that faith now in this country are ignorant and weak, unable to do any thing extraordinary, while the idolaters have power to do whatever they please.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	725	While I am seated at table, the cups, filled with wine or other beverage, come to me from the middle of the hall spontaneously, without being touched by any human hand.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	726	They are able to control bad weather, and force it to retire to any quarter of the heavens; they can perform other wonderful things of the same nature.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	727	You have witnessed their idols exercising the faculty of speech, and predicting whatever events are inquired into.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	728	Should I become a convert and profess Christianity, the nobles of my court, and others disinclined to the faith, will ask what adequate motives have induced me to be baptized.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	729	‘What wonders, what miracles, they will say, have its ministers performed!
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	730	But the idolaters declare, that their exhibitions are made through their own holiness and the might of their idols.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	731	To this I shall be unable to make any answer, and be considered as labouring under a grievous mistake, while the heathen teachers, by the profound art which they display, may easily accomplish my death.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	732	Return, however, to your pontiff, and present to him my request, that he would send a hundred persons learned in your law, who, when confronted with the others, will be able to control them, and while proving themselves endowed with similar skill, shall render their antagonists unable in their presence to carry on these practices.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	733	On witnessing this, I will interdict the exercise of their religion, and suffer myself to be baptized.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	734	This example will be followed by all my nobility, and by my subjects in general ; so that the Christians in these regions will become more numerous than those inhabiting yourowncountry”.
1	part1	7	His Opinions as to the Christian Religion	735	From this language it evidently appears that had the pope sent out persons duly qualified to preach the gospel, the great khan would have embraced that faith, for which he certainly entertained a strong predilection.
