Now I am to tell you of a great miracle which happened between Baldach and Mosul in the year 1225. There was a caliph in the former who held the Christians in great hatred, as it is natural for all the Saracens in the world to do, He thought day and night how he might compel all those in his country to become converts, or else kill them. Many others concurred in that wicked purpose, and they agreed upon this plan : They found in the gospel a text saying that if a Christian had as much faith as a grain of mustard-seed and made his prayer to God, he would be able to join two mountains together. On finding this text, they felt great joy, thinking they had thus either a means of converting them, or a pretext for killing them outright. He therefore sent for all the Jacobite and Nestorian believers in his country, who were very numerous; and when they came before him, he showed them this gospel, made them read it, and asked if it were true. They replied that it was so. Then, continued the caliph, since so many Christians are here, there surely must be among you this small measure of faith ; therefore, said he, pointing to a large hill in view, you must remove that mountain, or I will put you allto death, because otherwise you must be wholly destitute of faith, and on that account deserve to die. If, however, you will turn to our good law of Mohammed, you shall be forgiven; and, in the mean time, I allow you tefi days to do what is required. He then dismissed them. On hearing what the caliph had said, they were in great fear, and knew not what to resolve. Then they all assembled, small and great, men and women, the bishop, archbishop, and priests of whom there were a considerable number, and they remained eight days and eight nights in prayer, that God, in his mercy, and for the diffusion of his faith, would come to their aid, and enable them to escape this cruel death with which they were threatened. But what have I now to tell you! While they were thus deeply engaged in prayer, an angel, by the message of God, appeared to a bishop who was a man of very holy life. He said, “Oh, bishop! do you now go to acertain shoemaker with one eye, and tell him that at his prayer the mountain will be moved.” Now this shoemaker was a very honest and chaste man ; he fasted and went regularly to mass, and ‘gave every day bread to the poor. I will tell you a thing that he did, to prove his good faith and life. It happened one day that a very beautiful woman came to his shop to purchase a pair of shoes, and in order to make them fit, he was obliged to look at her foot and ankle, and they were so finely shaped that he felt his eye take an undue pleasure in viewing them. As soon as she was gone, he began bitterly to reproach himself, and remembered the text, “if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee.” He then took a sharp weapon, and stuck it into his eye, so that it burst in his head, and he never saw with it again. Thus you see he was a most holy and good man. When, therefore, the bishop had this vision, he told it to all his people, and they agreed that this shoemaker should be called before them, and when he came, they requested him to pray to God that he would make the mountain move. But when the shoemaker heard what the bishop and the others said, he answered that he was not so good a man as that God or our lady should for his sake do so great a miracle. But the Christians pressed him so earnestly, that he at last agreed, and made the prayer. When the final day was come, they all rose early in the morning, great and small, male and female; and entering the church, they sung the holy mass, and then proceeded out to the plain in front of the mountain. They were fully a hundred thousand, and they all placed themselves in front of the cross. The caliph then came with a vast number of Saracens, eager to slay the unbelievers, for they thought it impossible the hill could be moved, and they themselves were in great fear and doubt ; nevertheless they had good hope in their Creator. Then the shoemaker fell on his knees before the cross, lifted his hands to heaven, and prayed fervently that the mountain might be moved, and the Christians there assembled escape a dreadful death. When he had made his prayer, it was not long before the vast eminence began to stir, and move from its place. The Saracens, on seeing this, wondered greatly, and many of them were converted ; nay, the caliph himself became a believer in the gospel, but secretly, and when he died, a cross was found round his neck; for which reason he was not buried in the same place with the other sovereigns, but in a tomb by himself. Now let us leave Baldach and go to Persia.
