Russia is a very great province towards the north, inhabited by Christians, who follow the Greek Church. They have languages of their own, and several kings. They are a very simple people, but extremely handsome, with a faircomplexion. The entrances and passes into it are very strong ; they own some small allegiance to the Tartar king of the West, named Toctai. The country yields few commodities, except an abundance of the furs already described, equal to any in the world. There are considerable silver mines. But now let us leave it, and describe the Greater Sea, with the provinces around. But first let me tell you of a province lying between north and north-west, and bordering on Russia, named Lac, inhabited by a mixture of Christians and Saracens, and subject to a king. The people carry on merchandise and manufactures, and have a vast variety also of valuable furs.t But now I must go back to Russia, and mention something that I had forgot. It is so very extensive as to reach the ocean, where are isles on which pilgrim-falcons and gerfalcons are found, and carried to various parts of the world. Now from Russia to Oroech is no great distance ; but the extreme cold renders the journey very difficult.This would be the time to speak of the Strait of Constantinople and the mouth of the Great Sea; but on considering that many others have written on the subject, we shall omit them, and proceed to treat of the Tartars of the West, and the lords by whom they are ruled.
