‘When a man departs from that city, he goes five days eastward through a country where there are many spirits, who are often heard speaking during the night. You then find a kingdom called Erginul,* belonging to the great khan, and included in the large province of Tangut. There are a good many towns, the chief one bearing the same name ; and the people are a mixture of Nestorian Christians, idolaters, and Mohammedans. Proceeding thence south-east, you come into the country of Cathay, when you will find in the way a city named Singuy.There are a good many other towns, still in Tangut, and subject to the great khan; and the inhabitants are as above described. There are a vast number of wild oxen, as large as elephants, and very beautiful, —their back being entirely covered with white and black hair, three palms long. These animals are also caught and tamed, when they do twice as much work as the common ox.This country, too, produces the best musk in the world, and I will describe the animal by which it is supplied. It is small, about the size of an antelope, which it resembles in the feet and tail, but has a soft thick hair like the stag, no horns, only four teeth, two above and two below, three inches long and very sharp. It is a beautiful creature; and, on its being taken, there is found a bag between the skin and the flesh, containing a bloody imposthume, which, when the skin is cut through, is drawn out, and forms the musk whence issues so strong an odour.In this country it is very abundant, and of good quality. The people also raise plenty of corn,and engage in merchandise and manufactures. The region extends to a journey of full twentyfive days. There are pheasants twice as large as ours, with tails from seven to ten palms long.Others resemble ours; and there are various birds, with finely coloured wings. The people, who are idolaters, are fat, with small noses, black hair, and no beard unless on the chin. The ladies have no hair except on the head, and are every way very handsome. The men are voluptuous, and are authorized by their law and usage to take as many wives as they can maintain. If a woman is beautiful, though of humble birth, a great baron readily espouses her, giving to her mother such a sum of money as may be agreed on.
