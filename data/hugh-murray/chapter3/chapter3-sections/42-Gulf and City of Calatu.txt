Calatu is a large city within the gulf of the same name, six hundred miles north-west from Dufar.It is a noble seaport, inhabited by Saracens, who are subject to Cormos. When the melik of that city is at war with a more powerful prince, he retires to this place, which is strong by nature and art, and finds himself secure. The people have no grain but what they import. Many ships bring the goods and spices of India, which are distributed throughout the interior, and many fine horses sent in return. But I must observe, that this city is at the mouth of the Gulf of Calatu, so that the melik can prevent vessels from sailing in or out without hisconsent. This power he often uses against the sultan of Creman ; for when that prince demands any exorbitant tribute from him or other vassals, they remove from Cormos to Calatu, and allow no ships to pass, whence the other prince suffers severely, and is obliged to abate his demands. The people of this country live on dates and salt fish, which are abundant ; but many rich men are well supplied with better food.
