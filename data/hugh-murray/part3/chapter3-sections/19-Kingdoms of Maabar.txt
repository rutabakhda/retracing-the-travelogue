When you depart from Seilan, and go westward about sixty miles,you come to the extensive provinceof Maabar, on the mainland. It is called India the Greater, and is indeed the noblest and richest country in the whole world.t In this province there are five kings, who are brothers, and the one that reigns here is called Senderbandi Davar. The largest and finest of pearls are found in a gulf between this continent and the island, having nowhere more than ten or twelve paces depth of water, and in some places only two. Vessels, large and small, resort thither from the beginning of April to the middle of May, and cast anchor in a place called Bettalar, about sixty miles out at sea; they then go in boats and begin the fishery. Many merchants, formed into companies, hire and pay the men employed. They gave a tenth to the king, and a twentieth to the Abraiamain, who enchants the fishes, depriving them of the power to injure the persons who dive under water for the pearls ; indeed he can enchant also all kinds of beasts and birds. The charm, howevet, lasts only during the day; at night the animals enjoy full liberty. When the men in the boats have found water four to twelve feet deep, they plunge to the bottom, and get shells called sea-oysters, and within whose flesh are found pearls of all sizes and shapes. These are brought up in very large quantities, and distributed over the world,—the king drawing from them a great revenue. During the rest of the year they are not found here; but at a place 300 miles distant, where they are taken from September to the middle of October.
