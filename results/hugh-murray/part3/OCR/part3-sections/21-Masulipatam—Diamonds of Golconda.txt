At this kingdom we arrive after departing from Maabar and travelling northward about a thousand miles. It is subject to a queen of great wisdom, whose husband died forty years ago, and her love to him was such that she has never married another. During this whole term, she has ruled the nation with great equity, and been beloved beyond measure by her people.They are idolaters and independent ; they live on rice, flesh, and milk. In this kingdom, you must know, is found the diamond ; there are several mountains, among which, during rain, water flows with great turbulence, and through wide caverns; and when the shower ceases, men search through the ground previously inundated, and find the gems, In summer, there is not a drop of water, and the heat can scarcely be endured, while fierce and venomous serpents inspire great fear; yet those who venture thither discover valuable diamonds. There is also an extensive and deep valley, so enclosed by rocks as to be quite inaccessible; but the people throw in pieces of flesh, to which the diamonds adhere. Now you must observe, there are a number of white eagles, which, when they see the flesh in the bottom of the valley, fly thither, seize and carry it to different spots. The men are on the watch, and as soon as they see the bird with the spoil in its mouth, raise loud cries, when, being terrified, it flies away and drops the meat, which they take up, and find the diamond attached. Even when the prey has been swallowed, they watch where the excrement is voided, and obtain in this way not a few jewels. Now this is the only country in the world containing these precious stones ; and do not suppose that the best come to our christian countries ; they are carried to the great khan and other lords of those regions, whose ample treasure enables them to purchase.I must mention, too, that here are made the most beautiful and valuable cotton cloths in the world ; also the thinnest and most delicate, resembling our spiders’ webs.They have abundance of animals, and the largest sheep in the world, with plentiful subsistence ofeverykind. I must now describe the place containing the body of the apostle St Thomas.
