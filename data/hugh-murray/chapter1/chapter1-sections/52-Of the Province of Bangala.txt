This is a province towards the south, which, in the year 1290, while I, Marco, was at the court of the great khan, was not yet conquered, but the army: was there, ready to march for that purpose. It has a king and languages of its own, and the people are most wicked idolaters. They are on the confines of India.The barons and lords of that country have oxen as tall as elephants, but not so weighty ; and live on flesh and rice. They have great abundance of silk, with which they carry on extensive manufactures ; also ginger, sugar, and many other costly spices. This place is visited by numerous merchants, who purchase slaves, make them eunuchs, and then either sell or convey them to other places.
