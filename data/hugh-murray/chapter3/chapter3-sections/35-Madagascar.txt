This is an island towards the south, about a thousand miles from Scotra. The people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed ; and they have four sheiks, or old men, who rule the entirecountry. This is really one of the noblest and greatest islands in the world, being reputed 4000 miles in circuit. In no region are so many elephants bred, and their teeth sold, as here and in Zanghibar. No flesh is eaten but that of camels, of which an incredible number are killed every day ; and being supposed better and more wholesome than any other, it is used if possible during the whole year.t The red sandal grows here to the height of our forest trees, and is sold with advantage to foreigners. Ambergris also abounds, from the number of whales which, as you know, yield that substance. There are leopards, ounces, and lions ; likewise various other animals, such as stags, wild goats, and deer, some of great size. The birds are equally various, several wonderfully different from ours. Many ships arrive with abundance of goods, as cloths of silk and gold, which are profitably exchanged for those of the country. Mariners, however, cannot reach the other islands lying south of this and of Zanghibar, owing to the violence of the current running in this direction. It is such, that while vessels can come hither from Malabar in twenty days, they spend three months in returning.  Now I must mention, that in these southern isles, the birds called griffon are reported to exist, and to appear at certain seasons ; yet they are not formed as we describe and paint them, half-bird, half-lion, but exactly like the eagle, only immeasurably larger. They are represented so huge and powerful, as to take up the elephant and carry him high into the air, then let him drop, whereby he is at once killed, and they feed upon his carcass. It is asserted that their wings are twelve paces long, and when spread out, extend thirty paces across ; they are thick in proportion. I must add, that the khan sent messengers to obtain information about the country, and also the release of one of his subjects who had been made prisoner. They and the captive related to him many great wonders of these strange isles, and brought teeth of a wild boar, inconeeivably large: I assure you, he found them to weigh fourteen pounds. You may thus judge as to the size of the boar ; and indeed some are equal to a buffalo. There are also giraffes and wild asses, and other beasts and birds wonderfully different from ours. To return to the griffon; the people .of the island do not know it by that name, but call it always ruc; but we, from their extraordinary size, certainly conclude them to be griffons.Having nothing more to tell of this island, I will go on to that of Zanghibar.
