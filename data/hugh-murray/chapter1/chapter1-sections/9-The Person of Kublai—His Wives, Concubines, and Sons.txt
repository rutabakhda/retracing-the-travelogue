The great khan, lord of lords, named Kublai, is of a fine middle size, neither too tall nor too short; he has a beautiful fresh complexion, and well-proportioned limbs. His colour is fair and vermeil like the rose, his eyes dark and fine, his nose well formed and placed. He has four ladies, who always rank as his wives ; and the eldest son, born to him by one of them, succeeds as the rightful heir of the empire. They are named empresses ; each bears his name, and holds a court of her own; there is not one who has not 300 beautiful maidens, with eunuchs, and many other male and female attendants, so that some of the courts of these ladies contain 10,000 persons; and when he wishes to visit any one, he makes her come to his apartment, or sometimes goes to hers. He maintains also a number of concubines. There is a race of Tartars who are called Migrat or Ungrat,and are a very handsome people. From them are selected 100 girls,t the most beautiful in all their country, who are conducted to court. He makes them be guarded by the ladies of the palace ; and they are examined if they have a sweet breath, and be sound in all their limbs. Those that are approved in every respect wait upon their great lord in the following order: six of them attend every three days, then other six come in their place, and so on throughout the year. It may be asked, if the people of this province do not feel aggrieved by having their children thus forcibly taken away. Assuredly not: on the contrary, they regard it asa favour and an honour; and the fathers feel highly gratified when their daughters are thus selected. If, says one, my daughter is born under an auspicious planet, his majesty can best fulfil her destiny by marrying her more nobly than I can do. On the contrary, if the young lady, by bad conduct or any misfortune, be found disqualified, he attributes the disappointment to her malignant stars.Know, too, that the great khan has by his wives twenty-two sons ; the elder was named Gyngym Khan, and was to be lord of all the empire after his father ; but he died, leaving a son named Temur, who in time will succeed ; he is a wise and good man, tried in many battles.t The monarch has also twenty-five sons by his concubines; and each is a great baron; and of the twenty-two sons by his four wives, seven reign over large kingdoms, like wise and good men, because they resemble their father,— and he is the best ruler of nations and conductor of wars in the world. Now Ihave told you about himself, his wives, sons, and concubines ; next I wil] relate how he holds his court.
