You must know, that beyond this kingdom is a province called Obscurity, because there never appears either sun, moon, or star; but it is always dark, as with us during twilight.The people have no ruler, but live like brutes. The Tartars, however, make occasional in roads in the following manner:—They ride on mares that have just brought forth foals, which last are left at the border. They then traverse the country, plundering whatever they can find ; and when they wish to return, the mares, seeking to find their young, know the way better than the riders.The people are all hunters, and take. great numbers of sables, black foxes, and other animals with costly furs. Those on their frontier meet them at a fixed period, purchase these skins, and sell them elsewhere with an ample profit. These people are tall and well made, but pale and colourless. The territory borders on one side upon Great Russia, of which I shall now proceed to speak.
