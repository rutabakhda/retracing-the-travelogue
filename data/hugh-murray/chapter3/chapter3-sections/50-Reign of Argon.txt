Argon was thus master of the palace andof the kingdom, and the barons from every quarter came to render him due homage and obedience. After governing some time, he sent Casan his son with 30,000 men, to the country of the Arbor Secco, there to guard and secure his land and people. Argon began his reign in the year 1286, after Acomat had ruled two years. The former, after holding the sceptre six years, died, not without strong suspicions of poison.
