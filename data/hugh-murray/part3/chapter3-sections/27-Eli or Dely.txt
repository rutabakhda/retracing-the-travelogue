Eli is a kingdom, about 300 miles west of Comari, The people are subject to a king, idolaters, with a peculiar language, and independent of foreigners, I will tell you fully their customs and manners, which you will understand better, as we approach nearer home. There is no port except a large river, with a good entrance. Pepper grows in great abundance, and there isa considerable produce of ginger and other spices. The king is very rich, but not powerful in men; yet his dominions have such strong approaches, that he has no dread of invasion. If any vessel destined for another port is driven hither by stress of weather, the people seize and possess themselves of all its cargo, saying, “You were going to another place, but God sends you and yourstome.” In this they think themselves quite guiltless. Ships come from Manji and other parts in the summer, load in eight days, and depart as soon as possible, there being no port, but dangerous sandbanks. Those of Manji are least apprehensive, being provided with large wooden anchors. There are here lions and other wild beasts, with good hunting.
