When a man leaves Yan-gui and goes fifteen miles  south-east, he perceives a certain city named Sin-gui, which is not very extensive, but has great merchandise and much shipping. The people are idolaters, use paper money, and are subject to the khan. ‘That city stands upon a river, named Kiang, which is the largest in the world ; being in some places ten miles broad, and upwards of a hundred days’ journey in length. Through it the inhabitants have a lucrative trade, which yields a large revenue to the khan. And on account of the many cities on it, the ships navigating and the goods conveyed by means of it are more numerous and valuable than in all the rivers of Christendom and the adjacent seas beside. I tell you Ihave seen at that city no fewer than 5000 ships sailing at once on its stream. For that river flows through sixteen provinces, and has more than two hundred great towns on its banks, The ships are covered, and have only one mast ; yet they are of heavy burden, and carry each from 4000 to 12,000 cantars. They have ropes composed of cane for drawing them through the water ; those belonging to the larger vessels are thick, and fifteen paces in length, being cloven at the end, and bound together in such a way as to make a cord 300 paces long.
