Departing from Pentam, and going 130-miles south-east, you find the island of Java the Lesser; but notwithstanding this title, it is above two thousand miles in circuit, with eight kingdoms, and the same number of crowned sovereigns.I will tell you the whole truth about it. The people are idolaters, and each nation has a language of its own.There is a very great abundance of treasure and costly spices, as well as of lignum aloes and many other woods unknown in our country. What will appear very wonderful is, that this isle lies so far south, that the north star is never seen. Now I will tell you of each kingdom by itself.
