Balk is a great and noble town, and was anciently still more so; but the Tartars have spoiled and wasted it, so that many beautiful houses and palaces of marble are now destroyed.It was here, as I was told by the people, that Alexander took to wife the daughter of Darius. The people revere Mohammed ; and at this point ends the dominion of the Eastern Tartars, this city being the boundary of Persia, between north-east and east. Now let us tell of another country named Dogans. On leaving Balk, you ride two days between north-east and east, and find no habitation, because the people have all fled to the fortresses in the mountains for fear of wicked men, who lay waste the land. There is no want of water or game, and lionsare also seen. No food is to be procured, but travellers must carry it both for themselves and their horses.
