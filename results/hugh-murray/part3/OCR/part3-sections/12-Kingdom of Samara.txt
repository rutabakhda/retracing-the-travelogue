When a man departs from Basman, he finds the kingdom of Samara, in which I myself, Marco Polo, remained five months, because the bad weather did not allow us to sail, Here neither the north star nor the constellation of the Greater Bear appeared. The people are savage idolaters, governed by a rich and powerful king, and owning a nominal submission to the great khan. During our stay, we landed and erected castles of wood and twigs, where we remained through the fear of these wicked men, who eat their fellow-creatures. The best fishes in the world are found here. The people have no wheat, living on rice ; and they make no wine. You must know there is a kind of tree, of which they cut a branch, and place a pot beneath, when, during the night, the vessel is filled, and very good wine is thus produced, both red and white. The tree resembles a small date-palm, with four branches, and when it ceases to give out more wine, they water its root, which causes it to produce again.* They have great quantities of very large Indian nuts, and eat all kinds of flesh, good and bad. Now let us tell you of a kingdom which is named Dagroian.
