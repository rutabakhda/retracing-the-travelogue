You must understand that a certain cousin of his,
named Nayan, who, like his ancestors, was his vassal, yet
had many lands and provinces of his own, and could raise
400,000 horsemen, being thirty years old,refused to remain
longer in subjection, and assumed the whole sovereignty
to himself. He sent to a certain great lord, named
Kaidu, a nephew of that monarch, but in rebellion against
him, and desirous of doing him the greatest injury. To
him Nayan proposed to attack the monarch on one side,
while he himself advanced on another, so that they might
acquire the dominion over his whole territory. Kaidu
declared himself well pleased, and promised to be ready
at the time appointed. He could bring into the field
100,000 cavalry ; and those two assembled a mighty army
on horseback and foot, and marched against the great
khan.
