Kesimur is inhabited by idolaters, who have a language of theirown. They have a wonderful knowledge of the enchantments of devils, making their images speak, and by sorcery changing the seasons, causing great darkness, and doing other wonders which could not be believed unless they were seen. The idols of this province are the heads over all the others, and went down hence to the neighbouring countries. The people are meagre and of a brown complexion ; but the females are very beautiful. They live on flesh and rice, and have a number of cities and castles. They have woods and deserts, and passes so strong that they have little dread. of an invader: their king rules with great justice. In this country are hermits, who observe great abstinence in eating and drinking, and carefully abstain from all offences against their faith ; and thisis done through veneration of their gods. They have abbeys and monasteries, are held in much reverence by the people of the country, and live toa great age.The coral brought from our land is sold more readily there than in any other nation. From this place you may go to the sea of India, and if we went farther we should enter into that country ; but being to return that way, we will then describe it in due order, and now go back to Badascian.
