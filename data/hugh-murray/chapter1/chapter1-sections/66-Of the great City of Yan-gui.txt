When a man leaves Tin-gui he proceeds a day towards the south-east,§ through a very fine country, finding towns and castles, and then comes to Yan-gui,a large and beautiful city, which has under it twenty-four, all good and of great trade. Its affairs are administered by one of the twelve barons of the khan ; Messer Marco Polo, of whom this book treats, governed it three years. Here are made many arms and other equipments for knights and men of war ; for in this place and around it numerous troops are quartered. I will now tell you of two great provinces lying to the west, and as I shall have much to say, I will begin with Nan-ghin.
