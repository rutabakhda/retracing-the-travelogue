Now it happened that, about 1187, the Tartars appointedaking, who was named in their language Gengis Khan. He was a man of great worth, sense, and prowess; and let me tell you, when he was elected, all the Tartars in the world that were scattered through those strange countries came and owned him as their lord. He maintained his power with great vigour, and the multitudes who ranged under his standard were almost innumerable. When he saw so numerous an army, he went conquering other countries, and made himself master of eight provinces ; yet he neither injured nor robbed the people of any thing, but placing them under leaders in whom he could confide, led them on to other triumphs. Thus he overthrew, as you have. heard, a multitude of nations ; and seeing his good command and mildness, they cheerfully followed him, upon which he formed the design of subduing a great part of the world. In the year 1200, he sent a message to Prester John, asking his daughter to wife. Hereupon that monarch was very indignant, and said,—"What impudence is this in Gengis Khan! Knows he not that he is my man and my vassal? Return, and tell him that I would burn my daughter sooner than give her to him, and that he deserves to be put to death as a traitor and disloyal to hislord.” He then desired the messengers to depart forthwith, and never return. They presently went away, and coming to their master, told him in order all that the other had said.
