You have now been informed of all the actions of the Tartars and Saracens, of their customs, and of other countries throughout the world, so far as they could be searched out and discovered. We have only declined saying any thing of the Black Sea and the surrounding provinces, although we fully explored them, because it would seemingly have been useless, and a repetition of what others relate every day. The Venetians, the Genoese, the Pisans, and many other nations, are continually navigating it, so that every one knows the bordering countries. You have been informed in a chapter at the beginning, of our departure from the great khan, and the trouble and solicitation which Maffio, Nicolo, and Marco had in obtaining his permission. You have learned also the accident whereby it was procured, without which we should have found it very difficult to return into our country. But I believe it was the pleasure of God, that they might make known the great things that are in the world, and, as formerly declared in the preface, there never was a man, either Christian or Saracen, or Tartar or Pagan, who explored so much of the world as did Marco, the son of Nicolo Polo, that noble and great citizen of Venice.Deo Gratias. Amen, Amen.
