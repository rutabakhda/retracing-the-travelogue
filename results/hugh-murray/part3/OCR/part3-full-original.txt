I.—India and the Ships navigating thither.
Havine described so many inland provinces, I will now
enter upon India, with the wonderful objects in thatVOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEA8, &. 27]

region. The ships in which the merchants navigate
thither are made of fir,* with only one deck, but many
of them are divided beneath into sixty compartments, in
each of which a person can be conveniently accommodated. They have one rudder and four masts ; while
some have two additional, which can be put up and taken
down at pleasure. Many of the largest have besides as
many as thirteen divisions in the hold, formed of thick
planks mortised into each other. The object is to guard
against accidents which may cause the vessel to spring a
leak, such as striking on a rock or being attacked by a
whale, This last circumstance is not unusual ; for dur-272 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEA8,

Ten small boats are also kept for fishing and various
other services ; two being attached to each bark.
‘When the ships have sailed a year, and stand in need
of repair, a fresh plank is fastened above the two others,
then nailed and cemented, till they sometimes acquire
a depth of six planks.* Having thus described the
merchant-vessels that go to India, I will tell you of the
country itself ; but first I must mention the many isles
in this sea lying to the eastward ; and first, of one named
Zipangu.
II.—Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither.

This is a very large island, fifteen hundred miles from
the continent.t The people are fair, handsome, and of
agreeable manners. They are idolaters, and live quite
separate, entirely independent of all other nations.
Gold is very abundant, and no man being allowed to export it, while no merchant goes thence to
the mainland, the people accumulate a vast amount.
But I will give you a wonderful account of a very large
palace, all covered with that metal, as our churches are
with lead. The pavement of the chamber, the halls,
windows, and every other part, have it laid on two
inches thick,t so that the riches of this palace are

* The division into compartments completely detached from
each other, and the use of a coment composed of lime and oil, is
still the system upon which Chinese Junks are constructed.

vol. ii. pp. 239, 240. The mention of whales, and of the proceedings in case of a leak, are found only in usio. The
advantage stated in the latter case is obvious and important ;
but we are not aware of accidents from whales being usual in
the Chinese Sea.

+ This is evidently Japan, The nearest, of the northern
island is reckoned by Mr Marsden (p. 572), rather seemingly
too low, at only 500 miles. Chinese 4 (about a third of a )

t The extent and productiveness of this empire, with the
studied exclusion of foreigners, are circumstances well known.
The gold mines are described as very considerable, and monopolized by the sovereign. The modern palace is not represented

incalculable. Here are also red pearls, large, and of
equal value with the white, with many other precious
stones.* Kublai, on hearing of this amazing wealth,
desired to conquer the island, and sent two of his barons
with a very large fleet containing warriors, both horsemen and on foot. One was named Abatan, the other
Vonsanicin, both wise and valiant. They sailed from
Zai-tun and Kin-sai, reached the isle, landed, and took
possession of the plain and of a number of houses ; but
they had been unable to take any city or castle, when a
sad misadventure occurred. A mutual jealousy arose
amongst them, which prevented their acting in any concert. One day when the north wind blew very strong,
the troops expressed to each other apprehensions, that if
they remained, all the vessels would be wrecked. The
whole then went on board and set sail. When they had
proceeded about four miles, they found another small
isle, on which, the storm being violent, a number sought
refuge. Others could not reach it, many of whom suffered shipwreck and perished ; but some were preserved and
sailed for their native country. Those who had landed,
30,000 in number, looked on themselves as dead men,
seeing no means of ever escaping ; and their anger and
grief were increased, when they beheld the other ships
making their way homeward.

The sovereign and people of the large isle rejoiced
greatly when they saw the host thus scattered and many
of them cast upon the islet. As soon as the sea calmed,
they assembled a great number of ships, sailed thither
and landed, hoping to capture all those refugees. But
when the latter saw that their enemies had disembarked, leaving the vessels unguarded, they skilfully retreated to another quarter, and continued moving about
till they reached the ships, and went on board without

any opposition. They then sailed direct for the principal
island, hoisting its own standards and ensigns. On seeing these, the people believed their own countrymen had
returned, and allowed them to enter the city. The Tartars, finding it defended only by old men, soon drove
them out, retaining the women as slaves. When the
king and his warriors saw themselves thus deceived,
and their city captured, they were like to die of grief;
but they assembled other ships, and invested it so
closely as to prevent all communication. The invaders
maintained it seven months, and planned day and
night how they might convey tidings to their master
of their present condition ; but finding this impossible,
they agreed with the besiegers to surrender, securing
only their lives.* This took place in the year 1269.
The great khan, however, ordered one of the commanders of this host to lose his head, and the other to be sent
to the isle where he had caused the loss of so many men,
and there put todeath. I have to relate also a very wonderful thing, that these two barons took a number of persons ina castle of Zipangu, and because they had refusedto
surrender, ordered all their heads to be cut off ; but there
were eight on whom they could not execute this sentence, because these wore consecrated stones in the arm
between the skin and the flesh, which so enchanted them,
that they could not die by steel. They were therefore
beaten to death with clubs, and the stones, being extracted, were held very precious.t But I must leave this
matter and go on with the narrative.

 

* Both in the Chinese and Japanese annals, this expedition
is related, and represented as having been rendered abortive by
disastrous shipwreck. In particulars, however, they differ from
each other ; while our traveller, having been in China when
the news arrived, had the best opportunities of gaining information. There is no reason to suppose, therefore, that his more
detailed account may not be generally correct.

+ The delusion of supposing persons rendered invulnerable
by the use of amulets, is stated by Mr Marsden (p. 575) to be
common in the oriental islands ; and an instance is mentioned
when the Portuguese were imposed apon by it.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 275

III.—Idolatry and Cruelty of the Japanese.

The idolaters of Cathay, of Manji, and of these isles,
have all a uniform worship ; their idols have heads respectively of the dog, the hog, the sheep, and various other
animals, Some have a head and four faces, others three
heads, one in the proper place, and one on each shoulder.
Certain images have four, ten, and even a thousand
hands, and these last are held in peculiar reverence.
‘When the Christians ask them why they form idols in
so strange a manner, they reply,—* Our ancestors left
them to us, and we will leave them to our children.”
The actions of these beings are so various and diabolical,
that they must not be mentioned in this book, because
it would be a wicked thing in Christians to read them.*
I shall only mention, that any idolater of these isles,
when he captures an enemy, who cannot procure a
ransom in money, invites his friends, who cook and eat
the prisoner, reckoning his flesh the most delicate food
that can be obtained.t

IV.—Sea of China, and numerous Islands.t
You must know, that the gulf containing this island

* The religion of Boodh, Jong the most popular in China, has
also been extensively diffused ugh Japan, so that the superstitions of the two countries are correctly represented as similar. The deformed and multiform idols, either native or introduced from India, are also common. Thunberg mentions many
in the temples at Miaco, each brandishing from twenty to fortysix arms.

+ This report, though probably quite unfounded, is not unUkely to have arisen during the atittored war waged between
the Tartars and Japanese.

} Ramusio begins this chapter thus : “ Departing from the
port of Zai-tun, and sailing a westerly course inclining to the
south, for 1500 miles, you pass the gulf named Keinan, the
navigation along the northern shore of which occupies two
mont It bounds the southern of Manji, and then
approaches the countries of Arica, Toloman, and many others
al ly mentioned.” Mr Marsden admits that the period of
two months is too large, and that the numerous and distant
coasts mentioned in the chapter are im roperly stated as within
the gulf, whereas they evidently include those belonging
to the Indian archipelage. Neither of these errors appears in276 - VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

is called that of Zin, meaning in their language the sea
opposite to Manji. According to skilful and intelligent
mariners, who have made the voyage, it contains 7448
isles, mostly inhabited. In all these there grows no tree
which is not agreeably fragrant, and also useful, being
equal or superior in size to the lignum aloes. They
produce also many and various spices, including pepper
white like snow, as well as the black. They yield also
much gold, and various other wonderful and costly productions ;* but they are very distant and difficult to
reach. The mariners of Zai-tun and Kin-sai, who visit
them, gain indeed great profits; but they spend a year
on the voyage, going in winter, and returning in the
summer ; for the wind in these seasons blows only from
two different quarters, one of which carries them thither,
and the other brings them back.t But this country is
immensely distant from India. You may observe, too,
that though the sea be called Zin, it is really the ocean,
just as we say the sea of England, the sea of Rochelle.t
The great khan has no power over these islands. Now
let us return to Zai-tun, and resume our narrative.

V.—Of Cianba, and Expedition thither.

On leaving that port, and sailing west and somewhat
south-west 1500 miles, you reach a country named Cian
our text, taken from the early editions. The mention, however,
of Keinan (evidently Hai-nan) shows some kind of information
in the person who inserted the passage in Ramusio.

“ The number stated is doubtless fanciful and e: rated ;
yet when we consider the various groups composing the oriental archipelago.—many consisting numerous islets,—the
whole amount must be very great. They are, as here justly
noticed, productive beyond any other part of the world in aromatic and odoriferous plants, also very rich in gold.

+ The distance would not be very formidable to a British mariner, but is otherwise to the ruder Chi: navigator ; while this
sea, too, is tempestuous and dangerous. The junks still perform
only one voyage in the year; and, as here correctly stated,
sail in the winter with the north-east monsoon, and return in
summer with the south-west one.—Marsden, p. 582.

+ The object seems here to be, to distinguish the ocean and
its branches from a great lake or enclosed sea, like the Caspian.
In Ramusio we have the Egean Sea, instead of that of Rochelle.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ABIA. 277

ba,* which is very rich and extensive. The people are
idolaters, have a language of their own, and 9 king, who
pays tribute to the great khan, but only in fine elephants
peculiar to the country. That monarch, seeking to
subdue him, sent, in 1278, one of his barons with many
men, horse and foot, who began to lay waste the country.
The sovereign, who was very aged and much afraid
of such powerful warriors, did not venture to engage
them on the open plain, remaining secure in strong cities
and fortresses ; but all the lands and houses were wasted
and destroyed. Grieved at the desolation of the territory, he sent messengers, who said to the great khan,
“ Sir, the King of Cianba salutes you as his liege lord,
and states himself to be a man of great age, who has long
preserved his kingdom in peace. He offers to be your
vassal, and pay a liberal tribute in elephants, and beseeches that your baron and army will cease to ravage
his kingdom.” The khan, having heard this message,
took pity upon him, and ordered his general to withdraw, and conquer another country ; and he has ever
since received this tribute of the largest and most
beautiful elephants.t In this kingdom, no handsome
girl can be married till the king sees her, when, if
pleased, he takes her to wife ; otherwise, he gives her
money, with which she can be married to a nobleman.
In 1285, when I, Marco Polo, was there, the king had
326 sons and daughters, of whom 150 were men that

Ciampa, a maritime country between Cochin-china and Camboia, and which, projecting beyond the former, terminates the

ies.

+ It is sufficiently evident, even from our author’s narrative,
which was doubtless that current at the court of Kublai, that
the issue of this expedition was the reverse of triumphant, and
that the emperor granted such lenient terms solely because he
could not push his demands farther. It appears by Chinese
history, that the war was still more disastrous than is here re
resented, their army being closely hemmed in, and with difReal effecting its retreat.—Marsden, p. 588. In the Crusca
MS. the tribute is said to have consisted of twenty elephants.278 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN 8EA8,

could carry arms. Besides elephants, the country abounds
in lignum aloes, and the wood called ebony,* which is
very black, used in making chess-boards and writingdesks. I now proceed to a great island named Java.

VI—The Island of Java.

Departing from Cianba, and going south and southeast 1500 miles, you come to this island. Good mariners, who know it intimately, describe it as the largest
in the world, with a circuit of more than 3000 miles, The
people are subject to a powerful king, are idolaters, and
pay no tribute to any other prince. The territory is
very rich, yielding pepper, nutmegs, galanga, cubebs,
cloves, and all the richest of spices. Many merchants
from Zai-tun and Manji come and carry on a great and
profitable traffic. Its treasure also is so immense, that
it can scarcely be estimated.t On account of the long
and difficult navigation, the great khan never could
acquire dominion over it.

VII.—Kingdom of Lochac.

Leaving this island, and sailing between south and
south-west 700 miles, you find two isles, a large and a

* Elephants abound in all the countries between India and
China, and Mr Marsden quotes the Flora Cochin-chinensis
for the copious supply of ebony, and its adaptation to ornamental farniture.

+ The dimensions here assigned are much ter than those
of Java Proper ; whence Zurla contends tt Borneo is the
islanddescribed ; but Count Boni seems to state sufficient reasons
against this opinion: Tincline, however, decidedly to concur with
a suggestion slightly made by Mr Marsden, that the great Java
of our traveller included both these islands. It is impossible
otherwise tomake even an approach to the dimensions here
stated, and the calling Sumatra ttle Java would be pre} ous.
It is also very unlikely that he should have omit mention
of Borneo, which lay so completely in his way. The pepper and
other spices were evidently procured in Java Pro] including,
indeed, several that are raised in the Moluccas anc other islan
to the eastward; but Java has always been the chief mart,
where the Chinese apparently found them assorted for sale.
‘The great abundance of gold (meant by treasure) could only
be found in Borneo.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN A8ia. 279

small, called Sondur and Condur.* Departing thence,
and going south-east still 500 miles, you find a very
extensive province named Lochac.t The people are
subject only to a native king, are idolaters, with languages
of their own. They are tributary to no power, being so
situated that no invader can reach their land ; otherwise

 

= These appear evidently to be Pulo Condore, s small grou,
off the coast of Camboia, and a common rendezvous of vessels
navigating these seas. But there is an extraordinary error in
the ion S.S. W., which, instead of bringing a ship from
Java hither, would carry it into the heart of the Southern
Ocean. It is found alike in the earliest editions and in Ramusio. The Basle gives no direction ; and Muller, intimati:
no difference, seems to imply the same in the Berlin MS. o!
Pipino ; but t suspect the learned editor has neglected the collation, as the Museum MS. and the printed edition agree in
making it south-west. I have no doubt Mr Marsden points out
the cause. Java was not in the line of the voyage, but described, as indeed is pretty distinctly intimated, from the report
of mariners at Tsiompa. Having given the description, he returns to that country and reports the trip thence to Pulo
Condore, which is exactly in the direction of south-west. In
Pipino, both MS. and printed, the expression is: “ Dimissa
it Java ;” which can quite bear the sense, “ Ceasing to
treat of ;” and probably a term of this import was in the original, which the other coprists and translators have misunderstood, and made it to imply departure from, &c.

+ The distance in Ramusio is any miles ; and Mr Marsden
concludes that it must be Camboia, the capital of which is by an
early writer called Loech. But all the best editions,—the
French, Paris Latin, Crusca, Pucci, and Pipino, make the distance 500 miles, so that the country reached must be the eastern
coast of what is now termed Malacca. There is, however, the
great error of making the direction south-east instead of southwest ; and this is common to the early editions and to Ramusio.
It is probably a mistake in sonying bad manuscript. Sceloc
and Garbin sound very unlike ; yet the number of letters is the
same ; a bad G might be mistaken for S,and 4 for 7. Gryneus,
who gives no direction in the preceding route, states here the
right one, south-west. It is the same in the French edition of
1556. The learned editor of the Novus Orbis might, from other
information, perceive this mistake. * Pipino, too, having made
the route to the two islands south-west, intimates here its
continuance (ultra guas ad quingenta milliaria est Lorach).
This correctness of the middle editions, while both the early
and late ones are erroneous, appears curious. Pipino translated at a time when he might ave access to excellent MSS.;
and being a learned man, might interpret them better than the
other copyists or translators. .280 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS8,

it would soon be subdued by the great khan. Brazilwood is in abundance, and gold in almost incredible
quantities. There are elephants and other animals for
hunting; and from this place is derived all the porcelain
that is circulated as money through the provinces now
described. I have only to add, that the country is difficult to reach; the king himself does not wish to be
visited by strangers, and thus no one knows his treasure
and condition.*

VIII.—Pentam and other Islands.

‘When a man goes 500 miles southward from Lochac,
he finds an island named Pentam, very wild, all covered
with odoriferous woods. Thence he navigates between
these two islands about sixty miles, drawing only four
paces of water, so that large vessels in the passage must
remove their: rudder. He then goes on south-east
about thirty miles, and reaches an island also named
Pentam, with the noble and rich city Malauir, having
much traffic in spices and other articles. The people
have a king and languages of their own.+

 

* This country, as above observed, must have been the
eastern coast of Malacca, which the Malays had only recently reached, and not yet given their name. It is difficult to find one resembling Locl unless it be in Ligor, the
seat formerly of a great trade ; ch and g being always interchanged. The coast is still little known or trequented, and
from the same causes, being out of the common route of navigation, and the people very rude. Gold dust is mentioned as
an export from aillits havens. Elephants’ teeth are also
noticed, and timber is plentiful (Milburn’s Oriental Commerce,
vol. ii. p. 320-341). The only mistake appears to be about the
shells used for money (cowries), which are found on the adjacent coast of Borneo ; but perhaps a quantity of imported ones
had been here seen. The words “ for money” are wanting in
the French,—probably an omission, as the Crusca has them.
Ramusio mentions “ a fruit called berchi, in size resembling a
Jemon, and of delicious flavour.” This is wanting in the early
editions, and Mr Marsden cannot find any confirmation of it ;
generally, however, the fruits of the country are said to Le good.

+ The navigation in this chapter is intricate ; yet I think it
may betraced. The first 500 miles is evidently along the coast
of Malacca, terminating at the island of Bintang. The next
60 must then have been through the Straits of Sincapore, whichAND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OP WESTERN Asia. 28]

IX.—Island of Little Java (Sumatra).

Departing from Pentam, and going 130-miles south-east,
you find the island of Java the Lesser; but notwithstanding this title, it is above two thousand miles in circuit,
with eight kingdoms, and the same number of crowned
sovereigns.* I will tell you the whole truth about it.
The people are idolaters, and each nation has a language of its own. ‘There is a very great abundance of
treasure and costly spices, as well as of lignum aloes
and many other woods unknown in our country. What

Mr Horsburgh (vol. ii. p. 177-182) describes as difficult, and in
many parts very shallow. He might then come to the island
of Pantjoor, adjacent to Sumatra, and which he also names
Pentam. Possibly, however, it might be Batang, and the 30
miles be along its south-western coast. We have seen our
author’s fondnoss for identifying names that are at all similar.
Ramuzsio’s text is here wry defective and confused, rendering
it impossible for Mr Marsden to form any idea of the course.
He makes the 60 miles south-east, and the 30 without direction ;
and he has nothing to show that there are two Pentams.

* The name of Lesser Java is evidently given, though it is
admitted with no strict propriety, to the large island of Sumatra. Its extent, its products, its people, are described with
very great correctness. The local details are more difficult to
trace, as the author has given neither distances nor directions,
names are much altered, and its turbulent little kingdoms are
liable to such constant revolutions, that the most powerful in
one age ceases to exist in another. Yet I cannot but wonder
that Mr Marsden (p. 600) should pass a general censure against
our traveller’s description, and prefer to it the meagre one of
Barbosa. I am convinced, however, that the learned editor
has misconceived the whole scope of thi Foysees which he sup
to have been through the Straits of Malacca, and along
the northern coast of the island. It appears to me, on the contrary, that they went through the Straits of Sunda, and then
along the western side. ‘his was, no doubt, a circuitous
route ; yet many motives might bias them. It appears from
Mr Horsburgh (vol. ii, p. 139) that the Malacca channel is
dangerous to those unacquainted with it, as the Chinese were.
Knowing the island evidently by way of Java, they might prefer the route familiar to them. We find them setting out with
a course of 130 miles in the best editions, and 100 in others, to
the south-east; a strange aberration from a track lying due
north-west through the Malacca channel. One or two errors
of-direction have been lately observed ; but these are rare, and
the versions in that case differ ; but here they all . Other
and perhaps more decided proofs will be developed in examining the details.282 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

will appear very wonderful is, that this isle lies so far
south, that the north star is never seen. Now I will
tell you of each kingdom by itself.

X.—Kingdom of Ferlech.

In that of Ferlech are Saracen merchants, who come
with their vessels, and have converted the people to the
law of Mohammed ; but only in the city, for those in
the mountains live like brutes, eating the flesh of men
and of the vilest animals. They worship various objects,
particularly the first thing they meet after rising in the
morning.*

XI.—Kingdom of Basman.

Leaving Ferlech, you enter Basman,t a kingdom by
itself, whose people have a language of their own, and
live without law, like beasts. They own the supremacy
of the khan, but pay him no tribute, because the great
distance prevents his troops from reaching them; yet
they sometimes make him a present of strange objects.
Here are wild elephants, and unicorns not much smaller,
being double the size of a buffalo. They have a large

* Mr, Marsden, observing that the Arabs convert the Malay
p into f, considers this place as Perlak, at the north-eastern

int of the island. Yet Tanjong Perlak is merely Diamond

int, nor is there any record of a kingdom or even cit

bearing the name. Our views would pie it about the middle
of the eastern coast, particularly in the kingdom of Siak, and
the name is not very unlike, though certainly with no striking
resemblance. The cannibals are the Battas, inhabiting the interior of the country, and who have always borne that reputation. * The Saracen religion was about this time established in
Malacca, and was therefore very likely to have partially made
its way into Sumatra.—Marsden’s History, pp. 261, 262.

+ Mr Marsden finds this kingdom in Pasé, formerly called
Pagem, a short distance west of Diamond Point. Count Boni,
urging that the sovereignties could not well be so crowded together, suppoaee Pasaman to be on the western coast. Our
views wot int to Pasaumah, in the interior from Palembang, near indeed to the western coast, yet communicating by
a large river with the eastern, to which its power, formerly
greater, may at this time have extended. On the whole, there
is certainly nothing decisive in these two stations ; but perhaps the next may be otherwise.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN Asta. 283

black horn in the middle of the forehead, and beneath
the tongue sharp prickles, which can inflict severe
wounds, Their heads resemble that of the wild boar,
yet they carry them bent to the earth. They are very
ugly, and fond of wallowing among mire.* It is not
true, as asserted among us, that they allow themselves
to be taken by a virgin, but quite the contrary. There
are here good and serviceable falcons, black like crows ;
also a prodigious number of monkeys of various forms
and habits. But you must know that those who bring
the little men from India practise a great deception. I
assure you the figures to which they give that name are
manufactured in this island in the following manner :—
There is a species of small monkey, with a face resembling
the human, which they catch, skin, and shave off all the
hair except on the beard and chin; having then moulded
them intoa human semblance, they dryand preservethem
with camphor and other articles. But it is a gross deception ; for neither in India, nor in any other country,
however savage, are there men so small as these pretended ones.t Now let us tell of a kingdom called
Samara.

XII.—Kingdom of Samara.

‘When a man departs from Basman, he finds the
kingdom of Samara, in which I myself, Marco Polo,

* The rhinoceros, an animal then probably unknown in Europe, is here described with considerable accuracy. We may observe, that the southern part of the east coast, where we suppose
our traveller now to be, is described on Mr ‘Marsden’s map as
fenny, and subject to inundation ; the situation best fitted for
this animal, which would be out of place amid the mountainous
tracts in the north.

+ We have here a curious mention of a fraud practised on our
ignorant ancestors. The belief of a nation of pigmies in the east
was prevalent in that age, and is countenanced in the travels of
Oderic and Mandeville. The former describes them on report ;
the datier arcs that re cee em home merchants, i BP
pears, took advantage of this delusion, by preparing and selling,
probably at high prices, specimens of” Bi pretended variety of
mankind. Our traveller’s good sense and accurate observation
enabled him to expose the trick.284 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEA8,

remained five months, because the bad weather did
not allow us to sail, Here neither the north star nor the
constellation of the Greater Bear appeared. The people
are savage idolaters, governed by a rich and powerful
king, and owning a nominal submission to the great
khan. During our stay, we landed and erected castles
of wood and twigs, where we remained through the fear
of these wicked men, who eat their fellow-creatures.*
The best fishes in the world are found here. The people
have no wheat, living on rice ; and they make no wine.

produced, both red and white. The tree resembles a

am convinced, on the contrary, that it 1s the Bay of Namaig
(Samanca, Horsburgh), at the southern extremity ; and this

sition, it is apprehended, forms a main key of the voyage.

t is mentioned that not only the north star, but those Of the
Wain or Greater Bear had become invisible. This last could not
be strictly true, but of course they were seen more partially the
farther south he went. At all events, the disappearance of these
northern starsis noticed more emphatically, and as taking place
to a greater extent, than in the middle part of the island, opposite the Straits of Sincapore. Does not this imply that he was
now on the southern coast, in about 5°S. lat. not on its opposite
one, above 10° northward? Again, in turning the western point
of this ba he would come upon the ocean, and encounter in all
its force the north-west monsoon, which, from October to April,
blows with + violence, accompanied with thunder and lightning (Horsburgh, p. 47). If they arrived at the beginning of
this period, the detention is easily accounted for. But thi

orsburgh (Introd. p. 4), an ight (Nauti jirectory,
p. 17), consider its range as not catering beyond 12° S. and
4°N. lat. It could not therefore reach the northern coast of this
great island, though stated to blow with peculiar force on the
western. Mr Marsden (History of Sumatra, p. 297) describes
the shores of this bay as occupied by a ferocious people named
Orangabung who had been the terror of all their neighbours
till lately, when their villages were destroyed. The Crasca
fires the name Samarcha, which comes still nearer to Samara.

small date-palm, with four branches, and when it ceases
to give out more wine, they water its root, which causes
it to produce again.* They have great quantities of
very large Indian nuts, and eat all kinds of flesh, good
and bad. Now let us tell you of a kingdom which is
named Dagroian.

XIII.—Kingdom of Dagroian.

This kingdom has a language of its own; the people
are very savage, subject to a king, but owning the supremacy of the great khan.t They are savage idolaters,
and have the following very bad custom :—When a man
falls sick, his relations send for the magicians, and inquire
if he will recover, as these deceivers profess to know,
by their enchantments and idols, whether he will live or
die. Inthe latter case, the friends send for persons who
place something over hismouth, by which he is suffocated.
They then cook the body, and all the kinsmen come
and eat his flesh, taking care not to leave the smallest portion; which they believe would breed worms,
and thus seriously afflict the soul of the deceased.
They next collect the bones, and place them in a
large and beautiful chest, which they carry to caverns
in the mountains, beyond the reach of wild beasts
or any other injury. When they take any man belonging to another country, who cannot redeem himself, they kill and eat him in like manner. This is a
very bad practice.t I must now, however, tell you something of Lambri.

* Mr Marsden (Histo: > B 88) mentions palm-trees, of
several species, from which the natives, in the manner ie,
scribed, extract the liquor called toddy, which in a few hours
ferments and becomes 4 intoxicati he cocoa-nut, mentioned
in the following seabenes, is equ y plentiful.

+ Dragoyan, Ramusio—Mr Marsden supposes this to be
Indragiri, on the eastern coast. On the contrary, we look
to the western, where the name most similar appears to be Ayer
Aje (Ayer Rajah or Indrapour, Milburn), in about 2° S. lat.,
and uear the Bl ‘ighest mountains of the island.

larsden has been able to find no confirmation of this
poo barbarous custom. The Battas, however, a numerous286 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

XIV.—Kingdom of Lambri.

Lambri is a kingdom having a sovereign of its own,
who owns the supremacy of the khan. The people are
all idolaters ; they have a great abundance of camphor
and other spices ; likewise brazil-wood.* This they sow,
and when it has grown to a little twig, they transplant
it to another place, and at the end of three years
root it up.t We brought some of this seed to Venice,
but it did not spring at all on account of the cold. I
will tell you another very wonderful thing ; for there
are men in this kingdom who have tails like dogs, larger

people in theinterior, are believed to eat the flesh, not only of their
enemies, but of condemned criminals. It appears alzo( Marsden’s
Sumatra, p. 388), that at the death of relations,a great feast is
held, and numerous animals killed, the blood of which is partially sprinkled over the coffin, A groundwork is thus afforded, Slneit a credulous fancy might work up into the story here
narrated.

* Mr Marsden proceeds on the supposition of this being Jambi,
on the eastern coast, yet repeatedly admitting that it has no
correspondence except the imperfect one of name. He hi
alludes to what we must with Count Boni in considering
the real site. De Barros, the early historian of the Portuguese
conquests, gives a list of kingdoms in their order : Daya,
bri, Achem, and others. The first and last of these being at the
north-west extremity of the island, Lambri must be in the same
quarter. It might seem, indeed, to be between them ; but the
historian concludes thus: “ Barros, Quinchel, and Maneoy
which falls upon Lambri, which is near to Daya, the first
we named.” This distinctly implies that Lambri was more
distant than Acheen, and hence farther south than Daya. Accordingly, in about 4° N. lat. Delisle’s map has, in conspicuous
characters, Labou. Mr Marsden has here alabu, which he describes (History, p. 185-188) as the seat of a considerable trade.
Mr J. Arrowsmith has it Analaboo; still evidently the same with
the Labou of Delisle, and, as I apprehend, the Lambri of De

and our traveller. "Now his fleet was here since, in the
chapter after next, it is mentioned as thence finally setting sail.
This is surely a strong confirmation of the voyage being along
the western coast ; for had their tedious detention been on the
northern, it was little likely they should then sail 100 miles
southward, without any object, and merely to return.

+ Ramusio represents this process as taking place with another vegetable resembling the brazil-wood, which Mr Marsden
conjectures to be indigo. Our text, taken from the early editions, makes the plantation to be of the brazil itself. In

than a palm, and who are covered with hair. They
remain in the mountains, never visiting the towns.*
There are unicorns, with various beasts and birds for
hunting. Now let us depart and tell you of Fansur.

XV.—Kingdom of Fansur.

The people of Fansur are idolaters, have a king, and
nominally acknowledge the great khan. Here grows
the best canfara fansuri, which is much more valued
than any other ; indeed it sells for its weight in gold.t
Wine is drawn from trees, in the manner described
above : another wonder is, that, in this province, meal
is obtained from them. These are large, the bark thin,
and the interior all full of meal. The inhabitants take

 

© It is rather mortifying, after Marco had repelled one fable
of this descrij pen that he should have given heed to another
so similar. larsden mentions reports he had heard of
savage men covered with long hair, and shanning all communication with the other inhabitants. I cannot hel p thinking it
rey probable, that the orang-outang or pongo of Borneo ma:
lurk in some wild mountainous recesses of this adjacent island.
Count Boni mentions, that Carletti, whose travels he had seen
in MS., states his having heard a story exactly similar to this
from his Chinese pilots.

+ Facfur, Pipino. Fanfur, Ramusio. Mr Marsden supposes this to be Kampar, on the eastern coast, in which
the Italian editor seems to acquiesce. I cannot but think
the real site perfectly evident, though in a very different quarter; for it must be the district which yields that very fine
camphor, for which the island is celebrated, bearing twenty
times the price of that of Japan. This is completely ascertained to be in the interior from Barus or Baroos, on the western coast, whence it is called over the east Camphor-Barus
(Crawfard’s Indian Archipelago, vol. i. p. 517). The very
similar expression in the text seems to show that the two
places, though with names somewhat dissimilar, are in fact the
same. Count Boni quotes from Abulfeda the notice of Fansur
as distinguished for this article, named Fansurensis. According to Captain Low, it is found 250 miles N. from Ayer Bongey,
on the western coast only, being scarcely ever seen on the opposite side of the mountains (Journal yal Asiatic Society,
vol. ii. p.45). It will be observed that the fleet had sailed on to
Lambri, whence in the next chapter we shall see it departing.
It was therefore by a detached excursion, or by diligent inquiry, that Marco gained his information respecting this important seat of commerce.288 voYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

it out, and make a very good paste, of which we often
ate.* Having told you of the kingdoms in this part of
the isle, I will say nothing of the two others, because
we did not. visit them. I will now, therefore, go to
another small island called Gavenispola.t

XVI.—Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and
Andaman).

Departing from Java and the kingdom of Lambri,
and travelling northward about 150 miles, you find
two islands, one of which is called Necuveran.t The
people have no king, and live like brutes, both men and
women going quite naked. They are idolaters, and
have forests of noble and valuable trees ; among which
are sandal-wood, the Indian nut, clove, brazil, and many
others,

Angaman is a very large island, without a king; the
people idolaters, resembling savage beasts; indeed they
are a most extraordinary race, having a head, teeth, and
jaws like those of a mastiff dog. They are very cruel,
and eat all the men of every other nation whom they

valued in Europe. usio has a passage stating that the
wood is as hard asiron, and sinks when thrown into water; that
it is capable of being split evenly from one end to the other,
like the bamboo ; that the natives make it into lances, which,
when hardened in the fire, are superior to those of iron. This
Mr Marsden observes to be quite an erroneous statement, as
applied to the sago, being applicable only to a palm of a quite
different species. ‘There is not the least trace in the early
editions of such a paragraph, which has evidently been interpolated by some inaccurate observer.

+ In the Crusca, Nenispola. It is curious that this island is
never again mentioned, and occurs only in it and the French
edition. Count Boni suggests that it may be Pulow@y,

t In Ramusio, it is added :—“ The other Angaman.” This
is evidently interpolated by some one who was ignorant of the
latter being too distant to admit of its being the island meant,
which is evidently another of the Nicobar group plainly designated under the name of Necuveran. The rude yet harmless character of the people, and the noble trees with which
the soil is clothed, are fully confirmed by good subsequent

authorities.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 289

can seize.* They have great abundance and variety of
spices, with fruits different from ours, but live chiefly on
flesh and milk. Having told of these various people, I
will now mention another island.

XVII.—Island of Seilan.

When you depart from Angaman, and sail. about a
thousand miles westward, a little to the south, you
reach the island of Seilan,t the very best of its size
in the world. It is 2400 miles in circuit ; yet I must
tell you that anciently it was larger, being 3600, as
appears by the old maps of the mariners on that sea ; but
the north wind blows with such violence, that a great
part has been carried away by the water.[ The people
have a king called Sendemain, and are tributary to none ;
they are idolaters, and go quite naked, except a small
covering round the middle. They have no grain but
rice, living on it and on flesh. I will now describe
the most precious thing in the world; for here are
noble and beautiful rubies, which can be procured nowhere else ; also the sapphire, the topaz, the amethyst,
and various other precious stones. The king has the
most beautiful ruby that ever was or can be in the whole
world. It is the most splendid object on earth, and
seems to glow like fire; it is of such value as money

 

* The group of the Andamans is here manifestly pointed out.
All accounts agree as to the ferocious and intractable disposition
of the inhabitants ; Mr Colebrook considers them as perhaps the
least civilized race in the world. It is even strongly reported,
though seemingly not proved,that they are guilty of cannibalism.
The resemblance to the canine race is too strongly stated ; yet
they belong to that of the Papuas or oriental negroes, whose generally de ied visage, with a projection in the lower part of
the face, gives a considerable similarity to the animal mentioned.

+ This is evidently the well-known island of Ceylon, and
both the distance and direction are here extremely correct.

+ The maps of Ptolemy, to which the Arab navigators were
accustomed to pay great regard, represent the island of Taprobane under very exaggerated dimensions. Finding these erroneous, yet not willing to believe him mistaken, they probably
reconciled the difference by the unfounded theory stated in
the text.

could scarcely purchase.* The great khan sent his
messengers to him, wishing to buy it, and offering
the value of a city. The monarch replied, that he had
received it from his ancestors, and would for no earthly
consideration part with it. The people are not menat-arms, but unwarlike and cowardly ; when they need
soldiers in war, they send for those of another country,
commonly for Saracens.

XVIII.—Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan.+

T have also to tell you that in this island there is a
great mountain, of which the rocks are so broken that it
can be ascended only by chains of iron suspended, whereby men may mount to the summit. Here, according
to the Saracens, is the monument of Adam our first
father ;¢ but the idolaters consider it as that of Sergamon
Borcam. They describe this last as the first man whose
image they worshipped, and as the best that ever lived
in their country. He was son to a great, rich, and
powerful king, yet refused to succeed to the throne, or
to attend to any worldly concern. The monarch, who
had no other son, was both grieved and angry. He made
him large promises, offering even to resign, and raise
him immediately te the throne ; but the youth would
listen to no such proposal. The father was like to

* Ceylon is described as peculiarly distinguished for the number and variety of its precious stones, but not, as our traveller
represents, for their excellence. Rubies are particularly mentioned in the foremost pe, and though they are usually small
(Milburn, vol. ii. p. 360), there seems no ii robability of some
one very tine specimen having been found. Count Boni refers to
a notice of the present one in Haithon’s History of Armenia,
ch, vi., a good and quite independent authority.

+ This chapter, in the French, Crusca, and Ramusio, is introduced some time after, as giving particulars previously
omitted. We have thought it more satisfactory, after the
sremple of the Paris Latin, to introduce it here as its proper

~ place.

{ The principal mountain in the island, and one of great
altitude, was really named Adam’s Peak by the Arabs, before
the arrival of Europeans. It is of difficult ascent ; and Mr
Davy actually mentions the use of chains in reaching its summit.—Marsden, p 671AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN Asta. 29]

die of grief, but bethought himself of a plan for bringing him back to the world. . He lodged him in a very
fine palace, and appointed 30,000 beautiful damsels to
serve and amuse him. The prince, however, remained insensible to their seductions, and led a more virtuous and
chaste life than before. Now his habits had been g0 recluse that he had never seen a dead person, or one not perfectly sound in his members. One day, happening to ride
across the path where a man lay dead, he was utterly
astonished, and asked of his attendants what that was.
This being explained, he inquired if all men died, and
being told they did so, he walked on, musing very
deeply. Some time after, he saw one unable to walk,
and with all his teeth decayed through extreme old age.
Having asked, and being informed what that was, he
declared he would no longer remain in this evil region,
but would seek a place where men neither died nor
grew old. He left the palace, and journeyed into great
and trackless mountains, where he spent his whole life
virtuously and chastely, observing rigid abstinence ; so
that had he been a Christian, he must have been a very
great saint. When he died, his corpse was carried to his
father, who, on seeing the body of one whom he loved
better than himself, was grieved to the heart. He made
an image of him composed of gold and precious stones.
All the people of the country adored him as a god, and
they say that he died eighty-four times, becoming first an
ox, then a horse, then a dog, and various other animals ;
but that the eighty-fourth time he became a god, and they
worship him as their best and greatest. These were the
first idolaters, from whom all the others in Seilan
were descended. But I assure you, many from the
most distant countries come hither on pilgrimage, as
Christians to the shrine of St James, and the monument
on this mountain is said to be that of the prince, whose
teeth, hair, and skull were preserved. But the Saracens say that it is that of Adam, our first parent.
God knows which is right, but one cannot believe the
latter, for the Scriptures of our holy church assure us292 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

that he died in another part of the world.* Now it
happened that the great khan, hearing that the tomb of
Adam, with the other objects mentioned, was on this
mountain, sent, in 1284, a numerous embassy, who
travelled by land to the island of Seilan. They went
to the king, and procured two of the grinding teeth,
which were very large, also the hair, and the cup, of
beautiful green porphyry. They then returned, and
sent notice to their sovereign of what they were bringing,
when he ordered his subjects to go forth and meet these
relics of our first father. All the citizens of Kambalu
came out; the chief men received the sacred objects,
and brought them to his majesty, who welcomed them
with great joy and reverence. I assure you, too, they
found this cup to be of such virtue, that when food was
introduced for one man, there would be enough for five ;
and the great khan declared he had tried this, and found
it the truth.t Now having told you truly all this history, I will leave it and relate other things.

* Sergamon, in Ramusio Sogomon, is a corruption of SaKracniaal, @ common appellation of Boodha, known as the chief
object of veneration in Ceylon, as well as Burmah. Mr
Marsden (p. 672), refers to an “ Account of the Incarnation of Buddha,” translated from the Burman by Mr Carey.
In accordance with our author, he is described as 3 young
prince flying into the wilderness, and in vain tempted by his
father with every species of splendour, and particularly with
female attractions, to return into the world. It is amusing to
observe how Marco, following the ideas of his ees is struck
with admiration at the senseless ascetic life led by this object of Indian idolatry. The doctrine of transmigration here
alluded to, also characterizes that creed. The French edition
in this pare followed is more copious than that of Ramusio ;
and such is frequently the case with the remainder of the narrative ; whereas the latter had hitherto contained usually all the
passages found in any other edition, with others peculiar to
itself,

+ If, however, the modern inhabitants may be believed, the
khan did not monopolize these precious relics. They still preserve in the great temple at Candy a tooth of that sacred personage, in honour of which a splendid festival and procession
are annually held.—Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol.
iii, p. 161.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 293

XIX.—Kingdoms of Maabar.

When you depart from Seilan, and go westward about
sixty miles,* youcome totheextensive provinceof Maabar,
on the mainland. It is called India the Greater, and is
indeed the noblest and richest country in the whole
world.t In this province there are five kings, who are
brothers, and the one that reigns here is called Senderbandi Davar. The largest and finest of pearls are found
in a gulf between this continent and the island, having
nowhere more than ten or twelve paces depth of water,
and in some places only two. Vessels, large and small,
resort thither from the beginning of April to the middle
of May, and cast anchor in a place called Bettalar, about
sixty miles out at sea; they then go in boats and begin
the fishery. Many merchants, formed into companies,
hire and pay the men employed. They gave a tenth to
the king, and a twentieth to the Abraiamain, who enchants the fishes, depriving them of the power to injure
the persons who dive under water for the pearls ; indeed
he can enchant also all kinds of beasts and birds. The
charm, howevet, lasts only during the day; at night the

but Mr Marsden, in making this remark, refuses to claim any
credit on that ground for the author, on account of his alleged
qroeral want of precision on these points ; but we have en
leavoured to show that most of his supposed mistakes havo
been in fact those of his learned editor himself, or of the corrupt texts to which he had access. He imagines the port sailed
from to be Columbo ; but gives no reason, nor can we discover
any, for a locality which would convert Marco's very aceurate
statement into one much the reverse. .

‘++ Maabar must not be confounded with Malabar, though it
has been so, and the latter term, in Ramusio’s text, is erroneae substituted. Signifying “the passage,” it appears to
pe y, to that chain of sand-| s and coral-reefs named Adam’s

ridge by the Arabs, and Rama’s Bridge by the Hindoos. Mr
Marsden has quoted several writers, both Arab and Indian,
applying the term Mabar, or Maber, to this district, which appears to include Tanjore and the Carnatic. The term India,
a8 we may observe more fully afterwards, was applied in that
if? nerally to the southern countries of Asia, among which

lindostan is justly distinguished as the greatest and finest.294 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

animals enjoy full liberty. When the men in the boats
have found water four to twelve feet deep, they plunge to
the bottom, and get shells called sea-oysters, and within whose flesh are found pearls of all sizes and shapes.
These are brought up in very large quantities, and distributed over the world,—the king drawing from them
a great revenue.* During the rest of the year they
are not found here; but at a place 300 miles distant,
where they are taken from September to the middle of
October.

XX.—Hindoo Customs and Superstitions.

Now, in all this province of Maabar, there is not a
tailor, for the people go naked at every season. The
air is always so temperate, that they wear only a
piece of cloth round the middle. ‘The king is dressed
just like the others, except that his cloth is finer,t
and he wears a necklace full set with rubies, sapphires,
emeralds, and other precious stones, worth a great treasure. He has also suspended from his neck a silken
cord, reaching a pace down, and containing 104 of the
largest pearls and most valuable rubies. It is worn because he repeats every day, morning and evening, 104
prayers in honour of his idols. To this he is bound by
his faith and religion, by the example and injunction of
his ancestors.{ He wears also round three parts both

* This account of the place, the period, and the mode of
taking the pearls, is accordant with the best modern observations. The king still claims the same right, but prefers to make
it available by farming the privilege to the merchants engaged. The operatives, however, are paid by shares of the
produce. Among these the enchanters are considered as indispensable as ever, to secure the divers against the sharks, who
are the ravenous fishes here alluded to.—Maraden, p. 627-630.

+ Mr Marsden quotes Sonnerat and Barthema in confirmation of this statement. We may add, that Dubois (Manners
and Customs of India, 4to, pp. 204, 205) represents this as still
the genuine Hindoo dress, though those connected with the
Mohammedan courts have adopted from them in addition the
turban and the muslin robe enveloping the person.

t The use of such chaplets or rosaries, to accompany prayers,
is common among the votaries of the Bramin and Boodhist
religions, as well as of the Catholic. According to Mr Mars-AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 295

of his arms and legs, bracelets of gold, full of goodly
stones and pearls. In short, the number of his jewels
is surprising, being of more value than a handsome city,
and no wonder, since they are all produced in his own
dominions. No man is allowed to export either a pearl
or stone of great value, but must produce it to him,
and as he gives double its cost, they do so very willingly,
whence he has collected so ample a store. Now I must
tell you of other marvellous things: he has 500 wives ;
and as soon as he sees a beautiful lady, takes and
keeps her for himself.* He did the same in the case
of a very handsome wife of his brother, who, being
&@ prudent man, submitted, and did not quarrel on
that account.t The king has certain faithful adherents,
who attend him on horseback wherever he goes, and
hold great commands under him ; nay, what is wonderful, they serve him both in this and in the other world.
‘Whenever he dies, and his body is thrown into a
great fire, these vassals throw themselves after him,
that they may accompany and serve him still in the
future state.{ It is the national custom that, when
the king dies, and leaves a great treasure, his son will
not spend it for the world; saying, I have all my
father’s kingdom and people, why should I not support
myself as he did. Thus the treasure collected in this
kingdom becomes immense.

 

den’s best information, the number of beads is 108,—a small
discrepancy. In Ramusio (only), it is added that the daily
prayer consists in the repetition of the word pacauca.

*Ramusio says, “ at least a thousand ;” but the present
number only is stated in the French, Crusca, and other early
versions, and is surely amply sufficient.

+ In usio, this forbearance is ascribed to the interposition of their mother ; which, in the early versions, is introduced
elsewhere, and in more general torms.

t The examples of the servants of Indian Princes burning
themselves along with their masters, are stated by Mr Marsden
to be numerous ; and he quotes from Barbosa and the early
Arabians instances of its being done by a previous voluntary
en; ment.

‘he accumulation of treasure, so rare in Europe, is a general policy of oriental princes.296 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

In this country no horses are reared, and hence the
greater part of the revenue is employed in obtaining
them from foreign regions. The merchants of Curmos,
of Quisci, of Dufar, of Soer, and of Aden, whose provinces
contain many steeds of fine quality, purchase, embark, and bring them to the king and his four princely
brothers, selling them for 500 sagi of gold, worth more
than 100 mares of silver. I assure you, this monarch
buys annually more than 2000, but, by the end of the
year, they are all dead, from wanting the medicine
necessary to keep them in health. The merchants who
import them wish this to happen, and are therefore
careful not to introduce the cure.* Another custom
is, that when a man has committed a crime, and is condemned to die, he expresses a wish to devote himself in
honour of a certain divinity, to which the king consents.
Then his relations and friends place him on a wagon,
giving him twelve knives, and lead him through the
city, calling out, “ This brave man is about to kill
himself for the love of the great idol.” When they
come to the place of execution, he takes a knife and
cries aloud, “ I kill myself for the love of such a deity.”
He then, with different knives, strikes himself in one
arm, then in the other, next in the stomach, and so on
till he expires, when the relations burn his body with
great joy.t I must tell you another custom of this

* Mr Marsden finds undoubted testimonies, from Abulfeda to
Dr Buchanan, that no horses are bred in the southern part of
the peninsula ; but all those used are imported. Count Boni
(p. 172) has found in Tavernier and the Lettres Edifiantes, that
frequent medicine and peculiar care are requisite to keep them
in health.

+ The prevalence in India of the dark practice of religious
suicide is well known. There is no other authority for confining it to criminals, or even considering it customary in their
cage. The traveller may have witnessed an instance of the
kind, and applied it too generally. Mr Ward, however, observes that the practice prevails chiefly among those exposed
to incurable diseases, distress, or contempt. He reckons the
number who thus perish in Bengal at 500. The cutting with
sharp instruments is mentioned by modern writers, not as a
mode of producing death, but as an exhibition made by superstitious mendicants.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 297

country, that when a man is dead, and his body burned,
his wife throws herself into the fire with her lord ; she
is then much praised by the people, and many ladies
follow the example.* The men also of this kingdom
adore idols, and many worship the ox, saying, he is a
valuable animal, and on no account would they kill
him, or eat his flesh. Yet there is a race named gaui
who eat it, butas they dare not slay the animal, they
use only those that die a natural or accidental death.
All the people, too, anoint their houses with its dung.t
It is the custom also that the king, barons, and
other persons sit upon the ground, and when asked why
they decline a more honourable seat, they say, “ We
came from earth, and must return to it, and cannot too
much honour this common mother.” These gaui who
eat beef are the persons by whose ancestors St Thomas
the apostle was killed; hence none of this lineage
can enter the place where he lies buried, nor could
twenty men force them in, nor ten hold them there, on
account of the virtue of that sacred body.t

 

.

* The reader is probably familiar with the Suttee, or custom
of Hindoo widows burning themselves on the funeral-pile of
their husbands, now happily abolished by the British government. In Ramusio, it is represented as peculiar to the widows
of the criminal suicide ; but the early versions more correctly
report it as a general practice.

+ The degrading homage paid to this animal, as also the
filthy manner in which it is expressed, are well known; and Mr
Marsden has accumulated abundant evidence on the subject.
Dubois (p. 121) mentions that it is death to kill a cow, and
expresses his astonishment that the natives should not rise in
insurrection at the view of Europeans slaughtering and devouring in such numbers these adored divinities. That they merely
deplore it in silence is considered a striking evidence of their
tame and passive disposition.

t These gaui are evidently the outcast and despised race
named Pariahs, who, being excluded from all intercourse with
the higher castes, observe none of those restrictions as to
food in which the latter take pride. They are supposed to
form a fifth of the population of Southern India. See Account
of British India (Edinburgh Cabinet Library), vol. ii. pp. 333,
334. The odious character attached to them probably suggested to the Christians of the country the legend respecting298 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

In this country there grows no grain but rice. It is
remarkable that large fine horses in process of breeding
produce only ponies with twisted legs, unfit for riding, and good for nothing. The people go to battle
.with lance and shield, entirely naked ; yet are they not
valiant and courageous, but mean and cowardly. They
kill no animals of any description ; but when they wish
to eat their flesh, make them be slain by the Saracens
and other nations, whose laws and customs are different. Both men and women wash the whole body in
water twice every day, morning and evening, and till
then will neither eat nor drink. He who omits this
observance is regarded as we do a heretic.*

Very severe justice is executed upon those who
commit murder or any other trespass, When a creditor
has repeatedly applied for payment and been deceived by fallacious promises, he takes the following
course. He draws a circle round the debtor, who
dares not move beyond it, till he has either made payment or given good security ; and should he attempt to
escape, he becomes liable to capital punishment. Marco himself, when returning homeward through this
country, was eyewitness to a remarkable transaction
of this nature. The king owed a sum of money to
a foreign merchant, and being frequently solicited, he
put him off with empty promises. One day, when his
majesty was riding out, the creditor took the opportunity of describing such a circle round his person. On
seeing what had been done, the monarch immediately
stopped, and did not move from the spot till the demand was satisfied. ‘The people viewed with admiration this conduct, and pronounced their sovereign well
entitled to the epithet of just.t

Most persons abstain from drinking wine, and reject the
testimony or guarantee of those who indulge in it ;* also
of mariners, accounted a reckless and desperate race.
Dissolute conduct is practised without censure. The heat
is wonderful, and is the cause of their going naked. No
rain falls except in June, July, and August, and were
not the air cooled by showers during these three months,
it would be impossible to live. Many are skilled in an
art which they call physiognomy, which consists in knowing men or women, their qualities good or bad, by merely
seeing them. They regard augury beyond any people in
the world ; for, I assure you, if a man sets out on a
journey, and meets an omen deemed unlucky, he often
turns back.t Whenever a boy or girl is born, the father
or mother causes the nativity to be written out, the day,
month, and hour, and these are interpreted by astrologers
learned in enchantment and the magical art.

As soon as a son attains the age of thirteen, he is set
at liberty, and no longer allowed to remain in his father’s
house. He receives from twenty to twenty-four groats of
their money, and is then considered capable of earning
his own subsistence by some trade. These boys, accordingly, run about in all directions throughout the day,

 

exclusively in Ramusio. The drawing of the circle is
authentic Hindoo custom. Mr Marsden admits the ki

buying and selling. During the pearl-fishery, they frequent the beach and purchase from the fishermen five
or six small ones, which they carry to the merchant,
who, on account of the heat, has remained seated in his
house. They tell him what they have paid, and demand a reasonable profit, which he usually gives. The
day’s business being over, they carry provision to their
mothers, who prepare and dress it for their dinner ; but
they do not depend at all on their father for a maintenance,*

Here, and throughout all India, the birds and beasts are
different from ours, except one bird, which is the quail.
They have also bald owls, which fly in the night ; they
have neither wings nor feathers, and are as large as an
eagle. The eagles are black like crows, larger than
ours, expert both at flying and hawking. Another thing
worth mentioning is, that they feed their horses with
flesh and many other dishes cooked with rice. Their
monasteries are filled with idols, to whom many young
girls are devoted by their parents. They must go to the
monastery whenever required by the superior, which is
usually several times a-week. They there sing, dance,
and make great rejoicings. These young ladies also
prepare savoury dishes of flesh and other food, which
they carry to the sanctuary, and place before the idol
as much as would make a good meal for a great lord.
They then dance, sing, and rejoice, till time has been
given for him to feed on the substance of the meat,
when they take and eat it themselves, with great rejoicing. These ladies, who are very numerous, continue
the same mode of life till after their marriage.t Having

given you this full account of the manners, customs, and
doings of this kingdom, we shall depart and tell of another, named Mutfili.

XXI.—Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda.

At this kingdom we arrive after departing from Maabar and travelling northward about a thousand miles.
It is subject to a queen of great wisdom, whose husband
died forty years ago, and her love to him was such that
she has never married another. During this whole term,
she has ruled the nation with great equity, and been
beloved beyond measure by her people.* They are
idolaters and independent ; they live on rice, flesh, and
milk. In this kingdom, you must know, is found the
diamond ; there are several mountains, among which,
during rain, water flows with great turbulence, and
through wide caverns; and when the shower ceases,
men search through the ground previously inundated,
and find the gems, In summer, there is not a drop of
water, and the heat can scarcely be endured, while
fierce and venomous serpents inspire great fear; yet
those who venture thither discover valuable diamonds.
There is also an extensive and deep valley, so enclosed
by rocks as to be quite inaccessible; but the people
throw in pieces of flesh, to which the diamonds adhere. Now you must observe, there are a number of
white eagles, which, when they see the flesh in the
bottom of the valley, fly thither, seize and carry it to
different spots. The men are on the watch, and as soon
as they see the bird with the spoil in its mouth, raise
loud cries, when, being terrified, it flies away and drops
the meat, which they take up, and find the diamond
attached. Even when the prey has been swallowed,
they watch where the excrement is voided, and obtain in

this way not a few jewels. Now this is the only country in the world containing these precious stones ; and
do not suppose that the best come to our christian countries ; they are carried to the great khan and other lords
of those regions, whose ample treasure enables them to
purchase.* I must mention, too, that here are made the
most beautiful and valuable cotton cloths in the world ;
also the thinnest and most delicate, resembling our
spiders’ webs.t They have abundance of animals, and
the largest sheep in the world, with plentiful subsistence
ofeverykind. I must now describe the place containing
the body of the apostle St Thomas.

XXII.—St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him.

This is in a small town of Maabar, containing few
inhabitants, and seldom visited by merchants, there
being little trade, and the roads difficult. Many Christians and Saracens, however, resort thither in pilgrimage: the latter esteem him a great saint, and even
assert that he wasa Mohammedan. But I will now relate
awonder. The Christians, who repair to that shrine, take
from the place a red earth, carry it into their country, and
give a small portion to any person sick of a fever, who is
presently cured. But I have now a miracle to tell ; for
about the year 1288, a baron of this district had a great

 

* The diamond mines of Golconda, in the interior, are
celebrated throughout the world. This and Pannab, another
not very remote district of Hindostan, are the only quarters, previous to the discovery of Brazil, in which this most
valued of the precious stones was found. ‘The territory is
rugged and rocky, though not in the degree here described ;
and it really is in the moistened soil, after the inundation
caused by the periodical rains has subsided, that the diamonds
are mostly found. The story of the eagles must be classed as
fabulous ; yet there is no reason to mppose it of our author’s
invention. It is found in the Arabian Nights, where it seems
only adopted from the general belief of Asia. Count Boni
met with it in a scientific treatise on Precious Stones, Hecootly
translated by Signor Rainieri trom the Turkish of Ahm
Teifachite.

+ Masulipatam is well known as the chief mart for the fine
cotton cloths made on the coast of Coromandel,AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 303

quantity of rice, and filled with it all the houses around
the church. The pilgrims having thus no place to lodge,
prayed him much to desist ; but being fierce and proud,
he paid no regard to their entreaty. Next night, accordingly, Messer St Thomas appeared to him with a fork
in his hand, which he thrust forcibly against his throat,
causing severe pain, and saying, “ If you do not forthwith empty my houses, you shall die an evil death.”
He disappeared, and the baron rose early in the morning, related the apparition, and caused all the buildings to be emptied. The Christians greatly rejoiced,
and honoured this great apostle. I could relate other
wonderful cures effected on persons labouring under
various bodily infirmities; but I will now merely
describe his death. He had left his hermitage in the
wood, and was engaged in prayer, while around were a
number of peacocks, which are more numerous here than
elsewhere in the world. Now an idolatrous Gaui, aiming at one of these birds, let fly an arrow without seeing
the saint, whom, however, it struck on the right side ;
and finding himself thus wounded, he very mildly adored
his Creator, and soon after expired. But before coming
hither, he had converted many people in Nubia,* as I
will afterwards narrate.

‘When a child in this province is born, they anoint
him every day with the oil of sesamé, which makes him

 

* There can be no doubt, that, from the earliest ages of
Christianity, there resided here a body of Christians, who, with
or without reason, believed that they were converted by St
Thomas, and that he here suffered martyrdom. Meliapour, a
few miles from Madras, always, with the earliest European
travellers, bears his name ; even the Arabs called it Beit-tuma
or Temple of Thomas. Some learned writers maintain, that it
was not the apostle, but a Syrian monk of the same name, who

metrated into this region; but the contrary is the general

lief of the East. The events here narrated are stamped with
the credulity of the age ; yet in fact there is nothing in them
‘actually supernatural. e death of the apostle, as related,
might easily happen by mere accident ; and in the case of the
nobleman, there is merely a dream, which the representations
of the Christians, though repelled at the moment, might easily
excite in his min304 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

become blacker than at birth; for whoever ix most
deeply tinted is honoured in proportion. Indeed, these
people paint their god and all their idols black, and their
devils white as snow. The men, when they go to battle,
place such faith in the ox as a holy thing, that they
take the hair of the wild bull, and if they fight on a
horse, attach it to the neck ; if on foot, to their shield ;
thinking themselves thus better secured against every
danger. Hence, the hair of this animal sells at a considerable price.*
XXIII.—Lar ; the Bramins.

Lar is a province lying westward of this place, and

thence came originally all the Abraiamain in the world.

These are the best and most honest of all merchants,
and would not on any account tellalie.t They neither

 

* The inhabitants of this southern part of India are of a very
dark colour, and they have the custom of frequently anointing
their bodies with oil ; but there is no reason to suppose the two
circumstances connected in the manner here supposed. Man’
images of the Hindoo deities are formed of a species of black
franite, and some of their asuras or demons are painted white ;

ere, too, the motive assigned is probably fanciful. The hairs
of the wild bull are doubtless those of the yak or Thibetian ox,
which, under the name of chowry tails, are considered by
Hindoo grandees one of the most valued ornaments. The superstitious importance attached to them is nowhere else mentioned;
yet is not impossible. Probably, however, Marco had little
opportunity of confidential intercourse with the natives ; so
that, while he correctly observed their actions, he had not equal
means of penetrating into their motives,

+ The origin of the Bramins, who are evidently the order
here alluded to, has baffled the most learned inquirers ; and it
could not be expected that our traveller, in this cursory visit,
should throw much light upon the subject. Yet it is curious
that Ptolemy has placed in this quarter the Brachmani Magi ;
and Dr Buchanan mentions that the Bramins here consider
themselves a separate and superior race to those of the north ;
looking down with contempt even on such as serve the sacre
shrines of Benares.—Buchanan, vol. i. p. 308.

The position: of Lar or Lac, to the west of Madras, carries
us to Arcot and Conjeveram, the last noted for its splendid

odas ; and here, in fact, D’Anville, in his “ Antiquité de
’Inde,” places the ‘Brachme of Ptolemy. The appearance of
simplicity and austerity might easily impose on our author,AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN Asta. 305

eat flesh nor drink wine, are faithful to their wives, and
lead every way very virtuous lives. They take nothing
from any one, and do nothing that could be considered
asin.* They are all known by a silk thread worn over
the shoulder, and tied beneath the opposite arm, so that
it passes across both the breast and back.t They have
arich king, who readily purchases precious stones, and
enjoins that the merchants shall offer to him all the
pearls brought from Maabar, for which he pays double the
cost. They therefore procure them in large quantities.
Theyare idolaters,and regard omens from birds and beasts
more than any other nation in the world. I will tell
you one of their customs: when one wishes to treat for
any merchandise, he rises and observes his shadow in the
sun ; and if it be of the due length, on that day, according to certain rules, he makes his bargain ; but if it be
not long enough, he will not buy a single article. If
they go to a house for this purpose, and see one of the
animals named tarantula, which here greatly abound,
they observe if it comes to them from a lucky quarter, in
which case they buy ; but if otherwise, they give up the

 

who would have little opportunity of observing the frauds with
which this order are cl ated Account of India (Edinburgh Cabinet Library), vol. ii. p. 329-331. The mention of them
as merchants does not exactly accord with our ideas, and Count
Boni suspects they may be confounded with Banians ; but
the latter are chiefly confined to the great cities on the western
coast. Dubois informs us, that in this part of India many
Bramins pursue that avocation ; and we learn from Buchanan
(as above) that there are two classes, Vaidika, devoted to spiritual services, and Lokika, who follow secular employments.
The latter are regarded as decidedly inferior ; yet they do not
lose caste, and may intermarry with the others.

* Ramusio alone has an additional sentence : “ When any foreign merchant, unacquainted with the customs of the country,
introduces himself, and intrusts his adventure to one of them,
he carefully attends to his interest, and renders him a faithful
account, not even demanding any recompense, unless it is courteously proffered.” This editor also differs in saying that they
eat meat, and drink the wine of the country. unt Boni
is so convinced, and with reason we think, of this being an
error, that he has altered it in his reprint.

transaction and go away. Nay, I assure you, if one leaving
his house hears a man sneeze in a manner that does not
appear lucky, he stops and re-enters, Even if on his
road he sees a swallow approaching from the right or
left, in an unlucky manner, he returns.* Their teeth
are very good, through the use of an herb, which makes
them look extremely well, and is very salutary.t They
never bleed from the vein or any other part, yet perfectly preserve their health.

There are among them an order named cuigui, who
live to an extraordinary age, even 150 or 200 years,
yet can perform all the service of the monastery and
idols as well as younger men. This is owing to their
great abstinence in eating and drinking ; for they subsist
mostly on rice and milk. They mingle also quicksilver
and sulphur, making a beverage which they drink from
their infancy, saying that it lengthens their lives.t
There is also in this kingdom a religious order of more
rigid cuigui, observing the strictest abstinence, leading
a very rude and severe life, and going perfectly naked.
They adore the ox, and many wear on their forehead a

small effigy of one in copper or bronze gilded. They also
burn the dung, and reduce it to a powder, with which
they reverentially anoint many parts of their body, as
Christians use holy water. They eat neither from spoon
nor platter, but from large leaves, mostly of the apple
of paradise. Even these must be dry ; for if green, they
are said to have a soul, which it would be sin to kill;
and they would rather die than commit towards any animal an action believed unlawful. When asked why they
feel no shame in going naked, they say, because they
wish to have nothing belonging to this world, which
they entered without clothing ; and committing no sin, they have no reason to be ashamed. Besides, they kill
no living creature, neither fly nor flea, nor hog nor
worm, considering they have souls. They will sleep
on the earth without any covering, whence it is a great
wonder they do not die, much more that they enjoy
so long a life. They fast the whole year round, drinking only water.* Some reside in the monastery to
serve the gods; but before admission they undergo the
following trial. The young girls offered to the idols
caress these new candidates, and endeavour variously to
entertain them. Such as appear to take any pleasure
in these endearments, are rejected as unworthy ; but if
they show themselves totally indifferent, they are then
retained.t Such are the customs of these cruel and

 

© The term in Ramusio is singui; but that of cuigui in the
early editions comes much nearer to that of jogi, or yogi, by
which, as well as that of sannyasi, and sometimes fakirs, is
designated a much-noted class of Hindoo ascetics. Their rigid
abstinence, rejection of clothes, and scrupulous tenderness as
to animal life, have been observed from the earliest ages. The
leaf here noticed is that of the plantain, which really is of extraordinary size, and used by the natives to hold their boiled rice.

+ This odd trial is found only in the French and Crusca (not
in Ramusio), and I have not been able to trace any actual confirmation of it. It is, however, distinctly stated that the sannyasi, when raised to the rank of great gurus or teachers in
the temples, are required, from that moment, to renounce all
the pursuits and pleasures of life, and most especially the society and even sight of the female sex.— Dubois, p. 353. Buchanan, vol. i. p. 22; vol. iii. p. 79.308 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN S8EA8,

perfidious idolaters, who burn the bodies of their dead,
because otherwise they would breed worms, which after
eating the flesh would starve, and thus involve in great
sin the soul to which the body belonged. But I willnow
cease saying any more about them.

XXIV.—City of Cail.

Cail is a great and noble city, belonging to Asciar,
eldest of the five brother-kings. Its port is frequented
by all the ships from the west, Curmos, Quisci, Aden, and
the whole of Arabia, laden with merchandise and horses.
The merchants bring them hither as to a good market,
frequented by purchasers from other quarters.* The king
possesses immense treasures, and wears many precious
stones. He rules his nation very justly and uprightly,
for which cause the merchants frequent it, and afford
him great profit. He has three hundred wives and upwards, holding it a high honour to increase their number. When discord arises among the five brother-kings,
their mother, who is still alive, rushes between them,
and will not allow them to fight. Often, when they

* Cail or Kael is mentioned by different early travellers as an
important haven. Mr Marsden finds the name in Valentyn’s
map, near Tutacorin, in the Tinnevelly country. This, as

ill appear in the following chapter, would entirely derange
our traveller’s itine: 3 Which, however little it may be regarded by him, we reluctantly admit. The term, signifying

agoda, is found attached to different spots. We would suggest

oint Calymere, called by D’Anville Callamera Fagods. In
fact, Milburn (vol. i. p. 364) mentions that there are here two
remarkable temples ; a circumstance affording strong presumption of there having formerly been an important city ; and at
half a mile’s distance is still 'a large village, with considerable
trade. Here the passage from Ceylon is shortest, and the
small distance formerly stated shows this to be the vicinity to
which they crossed; and there has never hitherto been the least
mention of any movement southward. In the Crusca, and in
an Italian MS. of the French library, the name is Caver, at
once suggesting the great river Cavery, which falls into the
sea not far from Point Calymere. We cannot, it may be said,
take the benefit of both names ; yet it seems impossible not to
attach importance to this curious circumstance. If we place
Cail here, it will be presently shown that the traveller's itinerary becomes perfectly correct.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 309

will not yield to her prayer, and are about to engage,
she takes a knife and says, “ If you will not renounce
this quarrel, I will kill myself presently, and cut away
the paps with which I gave you milk.” When the
sons see this great piety in their mother, they feel themselves bound to make peace. But as soon as she is dead,
they cannot fail to quarrel and destroy each other.

All the natives here, as well as generally throughout
India, have continually in their mouths the leaf called
tembul. It affords them gratification, and its use has become quite habitual ; after chewing they spit out the moisture. The rich mix it with camphor and other aromatic
drugs, and even with quick-lime. When any one wishes to
insult another in the grossest manner, he spits this juice
in his face. The injured party then hastens to the king,
and declares his wish to decide the quarrel by combat.
His majesty furnishes him with a sword and small
shield ; and all the people assemble as spectators of the
conflict, which is only terminated by the death of one
of the parties. They are not, however, allowed to strike
with the point of the sword.* Now let us depart and
tell you of the kingdom of Coilon.

XXV.—Kingdom of Coilon.

After departing from Maabar, and going south-west
500 miles, you arrive at Coilon.t The people are ido
 

* This paragraph is only in Ramusio, where the sentence
referring to betel in the earlier editions has been expunged, in
order to prepare for it. The custom of mixing it with spices,
and even quick-lime, is correctly stated. In regard to the other
Pamtloalars, the only confirmation which Mr Marsden could

d is, that judicial duelling is practised at Onore, on the
opposite coast of Malabar.

++ Koulam, Ramusio. Mr Marsden naturally enough supposes
this to be Coulan, on the western coast, about 100 miles beyond
Cape Comorin. Count Boni, however, has clearly shows that
the place of that name described by Marco and other early EuTopeans lay to the east of that great promontory, from which
D’Anville makes it 15, and Rennell 60 miles distant. Milburn
has it stillin his map. Coilon being thus fixed here, and taking Cail at or near Calymere, the route of 500 miles south-west
becomes perfectly correct, instead of the enormous errors other-310 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEA8,

laters, yet among them are Christians and Jews. They
have languages of their own, and a king tributary to no
one. In this territory grows extremely good brazil-wood,
called coilomin. Pepper greatly abounds, being collected in the months of May, June, and July; the trees
are carefully planted and irrigated. Indigo also is very
plentiful and good, being made of an herb which they
place in a great vessel, then pour in water, and leave it
till the juice is given out. Being then placed in the
hot sun, it boils, acquires consistence, and becomes
what we see. In this country the heat of the sun can
scarcely be endured ; if you put an egg into any river,
it will be boiled before you have gone any great distance. Hither resort many merchants from Manji, Arabia, and the Levant, bringing quantities of goods, and
carrying away those of the country. There are various
animals different from all others in the world; such as a
black lion, without either spot or mark ; parrots of nu-_
merous kinds, some white as snow, with red beak and
feet ; others red and white, most lovely ; and some extremely small, and also very beautiful. The peacocks are
much larger, handsomer, and of a different species from
ours. The domestic fowls are also peculiar; in short,
they have all things, fruits, beasts, and birds, dissimilar to
ours, and both handsomer and better. They have no
grain but rice, and make a wine from sugar, which is
good, and intoxicates sooner than that from grapes.
Every thing necessary to support life abounds. Here are
a number of skilful astrologers and physicians, who
know how to preserve the human body in health. Both
sexes are completely black, and wear no covering except
a fine cloth about the middle.* Their behaviour to each

* These details resemble those formerly given, and are generally correct. This being the most southern quarter of Indii
the heat is of course peculiarly intense. The rude process
manufacturing indigo is said to be very tolerably described. By
the lion, the traveller usually means the tiger ; and this species,

as well as the panther, is stated by Paolino to be here of a very
dark colour.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 311

other shows little sense of propriety. A man will marry
his cousin-german, the widow of his father, and even of
his brother ; this is the custom among all the people of
India.

XXVI.—Comari (Cape Comorin).

Comari is a country of India, remarkable in this respect, that the north-star, which we had not seen since
leaving Java, appeared to us when thirty miles out at
sea, rising about a cubit above the horizon. There are
few domestic, but abundance of wild animals, particularly monkeys of various shapes, some of which would
almost seem to be men. There are cats of a very peculiar and wonderful species, lions, leopards, and ounces
in great numbers.* I will now proceed to Eli.

XXVII.—Eli or Dely.

Eli is a kingdom, about 300 miles west of Comari,
The people are subject to a king, idolaters, with a peculiar language, and independent of foreigners, I will
tell you fully their customs and manners, which you
will understand better, as we approach nearer home.
There is no port except a large river, with a good entrance. Pepper grows in great abundance, and there isa
considerable produce of ginger and other spices. The king
is very rich, but not powerful in men; yet his dominions
have such strong approaches, that he has no dread of invasion. If any vessel destined for another port is driven
hither by stress of weather, the people seize and possess
themselves of all its cargo, saying, “You were going to
another place, but God sends you and yourstome.” In
this they think themselves quite guiltless. Ships come

 

* Comari is evidently the country around Cape Comorin, the
southern promontory of India. While Coilon was supposed to be
westward, it appeared entirely misplaced ; but when the former
is fixed in the east, the cape comes quite in its place. The adFpeent territory is really described as rude and thinly inhabited.

former disappearance of the north-star, which seems to
mean the Greater Bear, must have been owing to the season of
the feats not, as he seems to Suppor, to his place on the earth,
for his track had for some time been considerably farther north.312 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

from Manji and other parts in the summer, load in
eight days, and depart as soon as possible, there being no
port, but dangerous sandbanks. Those of Manji are
least apprehensive, being provided with large wooden
anchors. There are here lions and other wild beasts,
with good hunting.*
XXVIIL—Melibar or Malabar.

Melibar is a great kingdom towards the westward, with
a sovereign and languages of its own.t The people are
idolaters, and subject to no foreigner. Here the northstar, at its greatest height, appears two cubits above the
water. From this and an adjacent province named Gozurat, there issue annually a body of upwards of a hundred vessels, who capture other ships and plunder the
merchants. Being sea-robbers, they carry with them
their wives and children, and remain together all the
summer, doing great injury to trade. These wicked
corsairs form what they call a ladder on the sea ; twenty
of them place themselves five miles from each other,
and thus command a hundred miles in extent. When
a merchantman comes in view, a light is kindled,

 

* Eli or Dely is evidently derived from Mount Delly, a small
space north of Cananor. A little southward it is a broad river,
with sport anciently flourishing; but Paolino found it,even in his
time, almost closed up, the trade being probably transferred to
Cananor and Calicut. The distance is very correct ; but the
traveller here and all along this coast, has given the direction
too much to the cardinal point of west, omitting to notice the
great declination southward.

+ This name is Malabar ; but Mr Marsden imputes a very

t error in beginning it here, while the small tract called by

e natives Malayalam lies wholly south of Mount Delly.
Marco, however, would naturally take the information from hia
Arab pilots ; and that nation, followed by modern Europeans,
invariably ascribe to it a much greater extension. The'very
term is Arabic, and, as well as the native one, means mountaincountry, which is applicable to the whole range of this western
coast. It is admitted that Abulfeda uses it in this extended
sense ; and Linschoten, ch. xlii. p. 77, states the Malabars as
extending from Goa to Cape Comorin ; which would, we apPrehend, nearly coincide with the popular ideas in modern

urope.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 313

which is repeated by one after another; so that no
vessel sailing here can escape them. The mariners,
however, knowing well their wicked customs, come
well armed and prepared, and fight a desperate battle,
often beating them off with loss ; but at other times fall
into their hands. The pirates then take the ship with
all the goods, but do no injury to the men, saying to
them, “ Go and collect another cargo, that we may have
a chance of getting it too.”*

In this country is a vast abundance of pepper, and also
of ginger, with a good supply of cinnamon and other
spices, also cubebs and cocoa-nuts. Cotton cloths, the
most beautiful and delicate in the whole world, are here
manufactured, with other valuable articles.t To purchase these goods, the merchants from other quarters
bring copper, which they use as ballast ; cloths of silk and
gold, sandal-wood, and other spices. Ships come even
from the great province of Manji; and the dealers
here convey the goods to various quarters in the west,
whence the most valuable are forwarded to Alexandria.
Having told you now of Melibar, we shall go to Gozurat,
but it would be too tedious to inform you of all the cities
of these countries, they are so very numerous.

XXIX.—Kingdom of Gozurat.t
Gozurat, too, is a great kingdom to the west, having

 

* Nothing can be more accordant with the tenor of history
than the piratical habits which the author ascribes to this and
the adjoining province. The rude temper of the mountaineer
tribes, and the numerous small harbours along the coast, have
led in almost every age to this enormity. Even Ptolemy has
designated it the coast of the pirates ; and Pliny gomplaing of
the losses there sustained by the East India trade. e only
extention erhaps is at the present, when it has been nearly
put down by the superior navy of Britain. In our traveller’s
time, there appears to have been no dominant power to keep
the marauders in check.

+ This coast is well known as the chief quarter whence Europe is spnlied with pepper ; and it is rich in other spices,
though of less importance. The cotton manufacture also flourishes, but the author is rather hasty in using again the superlative degree, already applied to those of Masulipatam.

+ It is impossible not to be startled by finding the name of314 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

languages and a king of its own, and subject to no other.
Here the north-star rises to the apparent height of six
cubits. The greatest pirates in the world live here, and
have a most wicked custom ; after taking a merchant,
they make him drink tamarinds and sea-water, then
examine carefully if he voids any pearls or precious
stones, which are alleged to be usually swallowed on such
emergencies.* There is in this land a great quantity of
pepper and indigo, with a good deal of ginger. Cotton also abounds, and the trees which bear it, when
twenty years old, rise to the height of six paces; but
the produce is then unfit to be spun, and can only be
used for quilting. Before twelve years, it is well fitted
for the former purpose.t An immense quantity of
"dressed leather is prepared from the skins of the goat,

 

Guzerat applied to this coast, under which it is never recognised
by Europeans, while he wilf be found not applying the term to
that so named by us. On this last point, however, Mr Elphinstone (History of India, vol. i. p. 550) states, that the name is
not known to the natives, who use those of Soreth and Kattiwar. Mr Hamilton (Gazetteer of India, vol. ip. 601) remarks,
that the greater part of Malwa and Khandeish was formerly
named Guzerat. Indeed, this must have been the origi

lication of the term, only extended to the peninsula by its
becoming part of the same Hceroyalty. This brings it very
close to the district here mentioned ; and the same power may
at the time have ruled over both. Linschoten, chaps. ix, x,
mentions, that all the ports on this coast contained numerous
Gozuratis, whom he combines with the Banians as the most
active merchants. Abulfeda agrees with our author in stating
Malabar and Guzerat as confining with each other.

* This coast, which includes the tract called the Concan, really is still more infamous for piracy than the one farther south.

 Gheria, in the last century, Angria had established a kind
of piratical kingdom, which the utmost efforts of the British
navy were required to extirpate.—Account of India (Edinburgh
Cabinet Library), vol. ii. p. 119-121.

+ The species described here is not the common cotton shrub,
which isan annual, but the bombaz or silk-cotton tree. In Ramusio, it is said to be “ suitable for muslins and other manufactures of extraordinary fineness.” Mr Marsden reasonabl:
suspects this to be a corruption ; and, in fact, the French abl
other early editions merely say, as in the text, “ well fitted for
spinning.” Even this is going too far; and the author seems
to have Jed into confusion by supposing the annual plant
to be the bombax in a young state.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN asta. 315

the buffalo, the wild ox, unicorn, and various other animals, and it is largely exported to Arabia and adjoining regions. Coverlets of red leather are also framed,
with representations of birds and beasts, most delicately
interwoven with gold and silver thread. They are wonderfally beautiful, and being used by the Saracens for
sleeping upon, are worth ten mares of silver. There are
also cushions woven with gold, valued atten marcs. In
short, this leather is embroidered for royal use, more
delicately than in any other part of the world.*

XXX.—Tana (Bombay).

Tana is a great kingdom in the west ; the inhabitants
idolaters, with a language of their own, under a sovereign
subject to no other. It does not produce pepper, or
such spices as the other provinces ; but yields incense, not
white, but of a brown colour.t There is a great trade
in leather finely dressed, also in good cotton, both raw
and made into cloth. The merchants import gold, silver,
brass, and other goods necessary for these kingdoms,
receiving various articles in return. But I have a bad
thing to tell you ; for many pirates issue hence, scouring the sea, and greatly injuring the sailors; and the
king sanctions their conduct, having made an agreement,
that they bring to him all the horses captured, which
are very numerous, being in great request over all India. But gold, silver, precious stones, and the rest of
the cargo, belong to themselves. Now this is bad and
very unjust conduct. Let us leave this country and
speak of Cambaia,

 

° We are not accustomed to view this as an Indian manufactare; yet Linschoten describes it in nearly the same terms ;
so that it appears to have flourished at an early period. The
practice of dyeing skins still prevails.

+ The name in jusio is Kanan; in others Chana and Caria ;
but Mr Marsden justly infers that the real one is Tana, on
the island of Salsette near Bombay; and this name is really
found in the French and Crusca editions. Marco is correct in
stating that no pepper is here produced. The incense described
is gum benzoin; but Mr Marsden infers that it must have been
imported from Sumatra, and only sean in the warehouses here.316 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

XXXI.—Kingdom of Cambais.

This is a great kingdom to the west ; the people idolaters, with a language of their own, and a ruler subject
to no other. Here the north-star appears more fully,
as it always does the farther you go westward. This
region is rich and productive, particularly in excellent indigo; also cotton, both raw and manufactured,
which is exported to many other countries. I may add,
many hides are dressed, and worked with a skill nowhere
surpassed ; also other articles too tedious to enumerate.
The foreign merchants bring mostly gold, silver, and
brass. The people are not pirates, but honest ; living
by trade and manufacture.* And now I will tell you
of Semenat.

XXXII.—Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut).

This is a great country to the westward. The inhabitants are idolaters, with languages of their own, and
@ monarch subject to no other. They are not pirates, but
live by trade and industry, as good men ought to do. ‘The
country is rich, and frequented by many merchants.
The people, however, are fierce and cruel idolaters.t

Kesmacoran is a kingdom with a sovereign and languages of itsown. The people are idolaters, and raise
abundance of rice, on which and on flesh and milk

* This is evidently Camboia, an important kingdom, the
capital of which is situated at the head of the of thas
name. The latter bounds the peninsula of Guzerat, of which
probably a considerable part is here included. The shores of
this inlet being out of the Areat maritime route, were not a
natural seat of piracy, with which indeed this country has
never been reproached.

+ This is evidently Sumnaut or Puttan Sumnaut, celebrated
for its splendid temple, destroyed in 1024 by Mahmoud the
Ghiznevide. See Account of British India (Edinburgh Cabinet
Library), vol. i. p. 194-196. The name is here generally applied
to the territory which we call Guzerat. The bad character of
the people is supposed by Mr Marsden to have been dictated
by religious antipathies ; but it appears in fact that the Kattees
or natives of Kattiwar are peculiarly barbarous and feroci

Society, vol. i. pp. 265, 278, 274.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 317

they subsist. There is a great trade by sea and land,
but nothing else worth mentioning.* Now this is the
last province found in India, in proceeding between west
and north-west ; and all the kingdoms already described,
from Maabar to this, belong to that India which is called
the Greater, and is the first of any in the world. I have,
however, only mentioned those on the seacoast, since to
treat of the inland ones would have been too tedious.
I shall therefore proceed to notice certain islands,
also belonging to India, and first two called Male and
Female.

+ XXXIII.—Islands called Male and Female.

The isle called Male is full 500 miles out at sea, south
of Kesmacoran. The people are baptized Christians,
attached to the law and customs of the Old Testament ;
they are very reserved in their intercourse with their
wives. All the latter, indeed, dwell in another isle which
is called Female. The men go and reside there three
months in the year—March, April, and May—when they

 

* Mr Marsden states that he felt difficulty as to this name, till
he applied to Major Rennell, who suggested that it was the same
with Kidg-Makran, usually applied in India to Mekran, the most
southern province of Persia. Kidg he supposed to have been
an ancient metropolis, whose name, according to a usage prevalent in India, was joined to that of the country. Pottinger,
gecordingly, found Kedge to be the actual capital of Mekran.
Having sailed along this extensive coast, Marco would enter the
Persian Gulf, and conclude his voyage ; but we shall find him
now describing on hearsay the extensive regions on the western
shores of the Indian Ocean.

+ We have observed that the Poli, with their fair charge,
would undoubtedly steer from the coast of Guzerat to the Persian Gulf, with the view of landing at Ormus. In undertaking,
therefore, to give us a view of the western borders of the Indian
Ocean, Marco could only be guided by the reports of his Arab
pilots. Though daring and skilful in their vocation, they could
not be men of highly cultivated minds, and were probably
deeply imbued with that taste for the marvellous, indicated by
the publication, during that century, of the celebrated fiction
of. the Arabian Nights. Mr Crawfurd has remarked the probability that at Sumatra he would be obliged to take on board
pilots of this nation, the influence of whose spirit may perhaps

e remarked during the whole of the subsequent voyage.318 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

return to their own residence, and spend the remaining
nine months in labour. In this isle is found very fine
and beautifulamber. The people live on rice, milk, and
flesh, and excel in fishing, capturing enough both for
their own food and for exportation. They have no
ruler except a bishop subject to the Archbishop of
Scotra, and have languages of their own. The isle
where their wives reside is thirty miles distant ; but
they could not live if they spent the whole year with
them. The sons remain with their mothers till the

of fourteen, when they go to join their fathers in their
separate abode.*

XXXIV.—Isle of Socotra.

About 500 miles south from these isles you find that
of Scotra, the people of which are baptized Christians,
and have an archbishop. Ambergris is very plentiful,
being voided from the entrails of whales, which are
pursued most actively, in order to obtain this precious
article. They strike into the animal a barbed iron 80
firmly that it cannot be drawn out. A long line attached enables them to discover the place where the
dead fish lies, and drag it to the shore, when they extract from its belly the ambergris, and from its head
several casks of oil.t Fine cotton cloth is made; and

* Mr Marsden supposes the islands here meant to be those
named Abd-al-curia or the Two Sisters, lying to the weet of
Socotra ; and Count Boni coincides. I cannot but remar!
however, that they are placed midway between Mekran an
this last, 500 miles from each, and the total 1000 is necessary,
and indeed not gaits sufficient, to make up the distance. The
two islands would, by the above supposition, be on the opposite
side of Socotra, and very near it, while the whole description
seems to indicate them as remote from any other land. ant
Boni, indeed, was informed by M. Zurla, that in the Soranzo
MS. the distance is made only forty miles ; but this codex, being proved to be of secondary importance, can scarcely stand
against the united voice of all the others. I cannot help sus
ing the whole:te be a mere flight of Arabian fancy. Mr
Mar len has found in Barbosa, and Count Boni in De by
representations of the females of Socotra as somewhat Amazonian, both as to valour and separation from the other sex.

This passage, though only in Ramusio, gives a tolerablyAND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 319

abundance of good salt fish prepared. The people subsist on rice, milk, and flesh; and go naked after the
manner of the other idolatrous Indians. To this island
come many ships and merchants ; and indeed all those
destined for Aden touch there. The archbishop has no
connexion with the See of Rome, but is subject to a
primate resident at Bagdad, who appoints him, as well
as sends mandates to bishops and prelates in other quarters of the world. Hither, too, repair many corsairs
with their ships, to sell their booty, and find a ready
market, because the Christians, knowing it to have been
abstracted from idolaters and Saracens, scruple not to
purchase.*

I can tell you, moreover, that these Christians are the
most skilful enchanters in the world. The archbishop,
indeed, forbids and even punishes this practice, but
without any avail ; for their ancestors, they say, followed it before them, and they will continue. For instance, if a ship is proceeding full sail with a favourable
wind, they raise a contrary one, and oblige it to return.
They can make it blow from any quarter they please,
and cause either a dead calm or a violent tempest.t

 

correct account of the capture of the spermaceti whale. The
opinion here given of the origin of ambergris has been controverted, but is the one now generally received. See Macculloch’s Commercial Dictionary, p. 30.

* Socotra is not much frequented now, when vessels studiously steer through the open ocean; but in an age when they
kept close to the coast, it became necessarily a main thoroughfare for those passing between the respective shores of Asia and
Africa. Mr Marsden has successfully proved its haVing then
been so, from the best early authorities. The same situation
would naturally render it the haunt of pirate ; indeed Abulfeda
actually charges the people as themselves engaged in that enormity. There is also abundant proof of their having embraced Christianity under a schismatic form, the Nestorian
or Jacobite.

+ A power over the winds is often claimed by sorcerers ; and
in this solitary island, surrounded by a stormy ocean, the pretension would be both natural and profitable. However little
our readers may be inclined to admit it, there is ample proof
of its being generally believed in by the early Portuguese navigators.320 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

They perform many other marvellous enchantments,
which it would be wrong to relate; they would excite
such amazement. We shall therefore leave them, and
describe the island of Madagascar.

XXXV.—Madagascar.

This is an island towards the south, about a thousand
miles from Scotra. The people are Saracens, adoring
Mohammed ; and they have four sheiks, or old men, who
rule the entirecountry. This is really one of the noblest
and greatest islands in the world, being reputed 4000
miles in circuit. In no region are so many elephants
bred, and their teeth sold, as here and in Zanghibar.*
No flesh is eaten but that of camels, of which an incredible number are killed every day ; and being supposed
better and more wholesome than any other, it is used
if possible during the whole year.t The red sandal grows
here to the height of our forest trees, and is sold with
advantage to foreigners. Ambergris also abounds, from
the number of whales which, as you know, yield that

 

* The present is believed to be the first notice conveyed to
Enrope of this t island. Its dimensions are exaggerated,
even if we take usio’s estimate of 3000 ; but in the earlier
editions it is as here, 4000. Considering this, with the mention
of the elephant and the giraffe,—animals not found in this
island,—I have little doubt that the Arabs combined with their
idea of Madagascar a large portion of the adjacent continent.
Comparing the pent with the following chapter, it will be
seen that they had not traced in any continuous manner the
coast of Eastern Africa, but had reached only detached portions.
which they conceived to be large islands. ym what is stated
respecting the currents, they evidently had not trated
through the Mozambique channel, and might easily suppose
the numerous islands in the northern part to belong to a mass
of land. The Moslem religion and Arab social system do not
now exist ; but there is full proof of their being formerly established, though expelled after the decline of that nation in
Eastern Africa, where, even at the arrival of the Portuguese,
they were found holding great sway. .

++ Camels are not found here ; and though Marsden mentions
instances of their flesh being 5 Prized as food, there can I think
be no doubt that the animal alluded to is a peculiar species of
ox or bison, with a hump on the shoulder, which Flacourt reports having been by some mistaken for a camel.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN Asta. 32]

substance. There are leopards, ounces, and lions ; likewise
various other animals, such as stags, wild goats, and deer,
some of great size. The birds are equally various, several
wonderfully different from ours. Many ships arrive
with abundance of goods, as cloths of silk and gold,
which are profitably exchanged for those of the country.
Mariners, however, cannot reach the other islands lying
south of this and of Zanghibar, owing to the violence of
the current running in this direction. It is such, that
while vessels can come hither from Malabar in twenty
days, they spend three months in returning.

Now I must mention, that in these southern isles, the
birds called griffon are reported to exist, and to appear
at certain seasons ; yet they are not formed as we describe
and paint them, half-bird, half-lion, but exactly like the
eagle, only immeasurably larger. They are represented so
huge and powerful, as to take up the elephant and carry
him high into the air, then let him drop, whereby he is at
once killed, and they feed upon his carcass. It is asserted
that their wings are twelve paces long, and when spread
out, extend thirty paces across ; they are thick in proportion. I must add, that the khan sent messengers to obtain
information about the country, and also the release of one
of his subjects who had been made prisoner. They and
the captive related to him many great wonders of these
strange isles, and brought teeth of a wild boar, inconeeivably large: I assure you, he found them to weigh
fourteen pounds. You may thus judge as to the size of
the boar ; and indeed some are equal to a buffalo. There
are also giraffes and wild asses, and other beasts and
birds wonderfully different from ours. To return to
the griffon; the people .of the island do not know it
by that name, but call it always ruc; but we, from
their extraordinary size, certainly conclude them to be
griffons.* Having nothing more to tell of this island,
I will go on to that of Zanghibar.

 

* The bird mentioned in this curious paragraph appears to
be either the albatross, which, though proper to more southern
latitudes, may have occasionally visited the shores of Mada
x322 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

XXXVI.—Coast of Zanghibar.

This is a very great and noble island, about 2000
miles in circuit.* The people are all idolaters, have
languages and a king of their own, and are subject to
no other power. They are not very tall, but so broad
and thick, that in this respect they appear like giants ;
and they are likewise immensely strong, bearing as large
a burden as four other men, which is really no wonder,
for they eat as much as five. They are perfectly black,
and go naked, with the exception of a cloth round the
waist. Their mouth is so wide, their nose so turned up,
their lips and eyes so big, that they are horrible to behold,t and any one meeting them in another country

car, or else the condor of Southern Africa. The former
fas been known to measure from wing to wing 15 feet, the
latter above 10. Ineither case the exaggeration is very pre :
the statement, however, varies much ; for the extreme length,
instead of 30 paces as here, in the Crusca is only 20, and in
Ramusio 16. The latter adds the account of a feather 90 spans
long, and the quill part two s in circumference, which was
carried to the reat khan, oy whom it was realy admired.
As nothing of all this is found in any early edition except the
Italian Museum MS.,—not a first authority,—we may conclude
it to be the unauthorized embellishment of some faithless translator. The statement rests only on the warm fancy of the
Arabs, here peculiarly excited by te mention of such a gigantic bird in the Arabian Nights, from which in fact they have
borrowed the name rukh. Nay, there appears to be throughout Asia a superstitious belief of its existence. The identity
with the griffon is admitted in the French version, here followed,
to be a comment of the writer’s own, for which I have no doubt
we are indebted to the romantic studies of Rusticians ; so that
two schools of fable have been at work in producing this extraordinary paragraph.

The boar here mentioned appears to be the boschwerk, called
by Linnzus sus ethiopicus. It has four tusks, the two largest
of which, nine inches long and five in circumference, project
like horns, being tamed up at the end, and rendering the animal truly formidable (Barrow’s Africa, vol. i. p. 303). A large
specimen might possess such a dimension as is here stated.

* This is evidently the part of the eastern coast of Africa
usually called Zanguebar, which signifies country of the Ethiopians or Negroes. We pointed out under the last chapter that
want of the knowledge of Africa, viewed as a continent, which
probably led the Arabs to consider this and other districts as

great traffic is carried on in their teeth ; likewise lions

they have all kinds of beasts different from others in.
the world ; including sheep entirely white, with only
the head black, and none of any other colour.* Here
too is the giraffe, a most beautiful creature, whose shape
I will describe. Behind, it is low, and the legs very
short ; while those before, and the neck, are very large,
so that its head rises three paces from the ground. The
animal is small, and is quite harmless; and its colour
being red and white, in circles, it is very beautiful.t
But there is a thing which I had forgotten about the
elephant, that it caresses the female in the same manner as the human species. I must say, the women
of this island are most ugly objects; with large mouth,
eyes, and nose, and their breasts four times the ordinary size; in short, they are hideous. The people live
on rice, flesh, milk, and dates, and though they have
no vines, make a very good liquor of rice, sugar, and
spices. There is a great trade, particularly in elephants’
teeth; and a good quantity of amber. The men are
very brave in combat, and have little fear of death.
They have no horses, but fight upon camels and elephants, placing on them castles well covered, with sixteen or twenty men mounted on them, bearing lances,
swords, and staves, and making a very powerful force
in battle.} They have no arms except leathern shields,

 

the life, yet very strongly caricatured. The traveller does not
intimate whether he had ever seen one himself. Probably he
had not, and received the description from his Arab shipmates.

* Mr Marsden finds this statement confirmed by Hamilton,
a good authority.

This elegant animal, now familiar in our menageries, is
here correctly described.

+ Tho traveller is correct as to the number of elephants, but
appears mistaken in supposing them tamed and trained for war.
‘They certainly were so by the Carthaginians ; but there is no
account of such a practice in modern times. He probably had
seen them so employed in India, and on learning that they were
here equally numerous, too hastily concluded that the same
course would be followed. He is correct as to the want of horsea,324 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

lances, and swords, with which they fight well. When
leading the elephant to the combat, they give him to
drink of their wine or liquor, which renders him more
-fierce and effective. I must now proceed to the great
province of Abascia, but first wish to say something
more of India in general.

XXXVII.—The Islands in the Indian Sea.

You must know I have described only its noblest
Kingdoms and isles; those that make the flower of
the region, and to which the rest are mostly subject.
No man could enumerate all the islands ; they are estimated at 12,700, inhabited and uninhabited, according to the writings of the most skilful mariners. In the
Greater India, which extends from Maabar to Kesmacoran, are thirteen very great kingdoms, of which I have
described ten. The Lesser India, stretching from Zinaba to Montifi, contains eight, and this is exclusive of
numerous others that are in the islands.*

XXXVIII.—Kingdom of Absscia.
Abascia is a very great province, called the Middle
India.t The supreme monarch isa Christian ; the other

* We have had occasion to observe the wide extension given
to the name of India. Here are clearly distinguished three
regions so named: the Greater, including Hindostan and Southern Persia ; the Lesser, or the country beyond the Ganges ;
the Middle, meaning Abyssinia. Mr Marsden has found, in
the early travellers, Conti and Barbosa, nearly the same limits
and divisions applied to this celebrated name. Indeed, in the
popular language of Europe, the term East Indies is still appiled to all the southern coaste of Asia, exclusive of China ;

ast being evidently added to distinguish it from the region
since discovered and named the West Indies. The islands here
mentioned are supposed by Mr Marsden to be the very numerous groups of the Maldives and Laccadives. He is doubtless
so far correct; but considering the extension of the name eastward, it seems probable that the Oriental Archipelago is also
included, especially when we find the mention of kingdoms in
these islands. In Ramusio, Zinaba is Zampa (Tsiompa), the
first kingdom reached after ieeving China, while Montifi is
Murphili, the name given in that edition to Masulipatam.

+ This is evidently Abyssinia, and indeed the name here
resembles mire that of Habbesh, used by the natives. The

jabasce,AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 325

six kings are subject to him, three being believers, and
three Saracen. The christian people of this province
have three marks upon their face, one from the forehead
to the middle of the nose, and one on each cheek, made
with a hot iron, and herein consists their baptism. There
are also Jews having a mark on each cheek, and Saracens
with only one on the forehead and nose.* The great
king lives in the middle of the province; the Saracens
towards Aden. In this district Messer St Thomas the
apostle preached, and after converting the inhabitants,
went to Maabar, where he died, and his body remains,
as formerly mentioned. This country contains many
good men-at-arms and well mounted cavalry, who
are much needed; for wars are frequent with the
Sultans of‘Adent and Nubia, and with other powers.
But I will tell you a memorable story of what happened
in the year 1288. This king, who is lord over all Abascia,
wished to go in pilgrimage to adore the sepulchre of
Christ in Jerusalem. The barons represented the danger
of the journey, and advised him to send a bishop or some
other great prelate. The monarch having agreed, one
of very holy life was chosen, who readily undertook the
mission. He was equipped most handsomely as a pilgrim, and travelled by land and sea till he arrived at

Barbosa, Linschoten, and other early authors, being intended, it is said, to represent baptizing by fire. Ludolfus, a
later but authentic historian, denies this on the authority of
the Jesuit missionaries, and says that such marks, though
sometimes made, are only as an imaginary preservative against
cold. There seems, however, full testimony to their early existence as a rite, though perhaps it has fallen into disuse.

easy, and indeed it is not improbable that the Arabian Aden
might at one period have extended its name and power to this
region. It is curious that in the Crusca, the one is called
Adenti, the other Edenti. The Jong wars between the two

Jerusalem. Repairing to the sepulchre, he performed
the due homage before an object so exalted; and
having presented great offerings from the king, and
well fulfilled his mission, he set out on his return. He
passed through Aden, a country where Christians are
hated as mortal enemies. The governor, learning that he
professed this religion, and was a messenger of the sovereign of Abascia, warned him, that unless he embraced
the law of Mohammed, he would suffer a shameful punishment. The bishop replied, that he would sooner die.
The other, greatly enraged, ordered him to be forcibly
circumcised, and then sent him away, telling him that
this was meant as an affront to his master. The prelate
was much grieved, but consoled himself by thinking
that he had suffered for the law of his faith, and God
would recompense him in the other world. As soon
as he could travel, he proceeded to Abascia, and appeared before the king; who, having inquired about
the sepulchre, and being told the whole truth, accounted
it a most holy and pious visit. The bishop then related
the affront put upon him by the ruler of Aden, when
his majesty fell into such a transport of grief and rage,
that he almost died. He called aloud in the hearing
of all the bystanders, that he would never wear a
crown, nor rule a province, till he had taken such vengeance as should be spoken of throughout the world.
Presently he prepared a vast body of troops, on horseback and foot, also elephants with well-armed castles,
having twenty men upon each. He then set out and
marched directly onward to the territory of Aden. Its
chiefs, with a great multitude of Saracens on foot
and horseback, came to defend their country, and a
most obstinate battle was fought ; but the enemy
could not withstand the force of the King of Abascia,
because the Christians are more valiant. They ficd
and were slain in great numbers. The victor, entering
the country in three or four places, greatly wasted and
destroyed it, killing many of the inhabitants. He
then thought the affront sufficiently avenged; and in-AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 327

deed I must tell you he could effect no farther devastation, the region being extensive, and full of dangerous
passes, where a few men could greatly harass an army.*

I will now relate other matters of Abascia, which yields
a great variety of all things necessary for subsistence.
The people live on rice, flesh, milk, and sesamum, and
have elephants, not bred there, but brought from the isle
of the other India. Giraffes, however, are in great
numbers ; also lions, leopards, ounces, wild apes, and
many beasts and birds different from ours, The domestic fowls are the most beautiful in the world ; and
the ostriches as large as asses. They have parrots, beautiful and various ; also monkeys and cats of two species,
with faces exactly like those of men. This Abascia contains numerous cities and castles, and is much frequented
by merchants; many cloths of cotton and buckram are
wrought there.t I might relate other things, but must
now go on to the province of Aden.

XXXIX.—City and Kingdom of Aden.

This country is subject to a lord, called sultan. The
people are all Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and wishing
the greatest mischief to Christians. ‘There are many cities
and castles; for Aden is the port to which the Indian
ships bring all their merchandise. It is then placed on
board other small vessels, which ascend a river about
seven days, at the end of which it is disembarked, laden
on camels, and conveyed thirty days farther. It then
comes to the river of Alexandria, and is conveyed
down to that city. By this route alone its inhabitants

 

* In Ramusio, the king is represented as having taken and
pillaged the capital. Mr Marsden is perplexed by Shading no
record of any such complete success. The text here given fro:
the arly editions exhibits it as only a partial and temporary
inroad.

+ This description of Abyssinia is tolerably accurate, considering the channels through which it was procured ; Heong
its features aro not sutficiontly distinguished from those of the
southern and central parts of Africa. The isle alluded to is
probably Zanzibar. In Ramusio, the country is described as
extremely rich in gold ; an error not in the early editions,328 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN 8EA8,

receive their pepper, spices, and costly goods.* From
Aden, too, ships sail for India with various goods, especially very fine and valuable horses, which, as you know,
are sold there for full a hundred marks of silver. The
sultan draws a great revenue from the duties on these
cargoes ; and is thus one of the richest princes in the
world. But, I assure you, he did great injury to the
Christians ; for when the governor of Babylonia attacked
and took the city of Acre, committing much devastation,
he was assisted by this prince with 30,000 horses and
40,000 camels. This aid was given rather out of hatred
to believers than good-will to that prince.t But now
I will tell you of another great city.

* The splendour and prosperity of Aden in this age is con
firmed partially by the oriental writers, and more fully by Barbosa. Moo: piel from it the image—

“* Blooming as Aden in its earliest hour.”

This wealth was derived, as here stated, from its being then the
main channel by which the Indian commodities reached Euro,
by way of Alexandria. At that time, it appears, ergs vee
did not venture upon the intricate navigation of the Sea,
and their cargoes were discharged at this city. After the passage of the Cape, and the improved navigation by which th
were enabled to ascend, Aden sunk into a mere place of refreshment for seafaring persons. In this view, and as subservient

n all the early editions, including Pipino an eus,
Red Sea is by mistake called a river. The Arabio ‘ona bahe,
water, is used indiscriminately in this sense, and in that of sea
or lake. This circumstance often causes confusion, and might
easily mislead our traveller. In Ramusio, it is properly
a gulf. He, or another modern editor, might easily have the
information necessary to make this correction. The voyage is
also stated at twenty days, a more suitable time.

+ The sultan here alluded to is supposed to be Saladin, the
celebrated ruler of Egypt 3 for Cairo was in that age called Babylonia, having, after the fall of Bagdad, become the capital
seat of Mohammedan power (Boni, p. 467). The French, Crasca,
and the Paris Latin give no date; but Pipino, Gryn and
Ramusio have 1200. e true one was 1187; but they might be
giving a round number, without attempting precision.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 329

XL.—City of Escier (Shaher).

Escier is a very large town to the north-west (north),
four hundred miles from Aden.* A count here rules
with justice, but subject to the soldan of Aden ; and the
people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed. ‘The port is
good, frequented by many ships and merchants from
India, who bring various commodities, and carry away
others, particularly horses of great value, and yielding
large profit. In this province grows a great quantity
of fine incense, also of dates.t They have no grain except rice, and little of that ; hence corn is profitably imported from other countries, Fish is caught in sach
plenty, that for a Venetian gros you may purchase two
large tunnies. The people live on rice, flesh, and fish, and
have no wine except what they make from sugar, rice,
and dates. But I must tell you, too, that they have sheep
without ears, or any opening for them ; but where the
ears should be, is a little horn; these are small and
very beautiful creatures.$ Another thing you will much

* There is a singular discrepancy here as to the distance ;
for while the Crusca and Paris Latin have four miles, Pipino
and Ramusio have forty, and the early French 400. This last
is undoubtedly correct, for Mr Marsden, notwithstanding his erroneous versions, clearly recognises here the Schihhr of Niebuhr, Sahar of D’Anville, situated at exactly 400 miles from
Aden. Mr Wellsted describes it under the name of Shaher, as
still the largest town on this part of the Arabian coast, extending a mile and a quarter in length (Travels in Arabia, vol. ii.
p. 443). In this, however, and the two following routes, the
early editions commit the heavy error of making the direction
north-west instead of north-east. I incline to sug; @ mistake of transcription ; for tramontane (north) might easily, in
bad MS., be mistaken for vermaistre (north-west). It is curious
that Pipino, Gryneus, and the French of 1565, really have north,
which is correct, allowing for the frequent habit of orienting to
acardinal point. We may refer to our observations in a former
instance, in which these middle editions were correct, while the
early and later ones were erroneous. Ramusio has a different
mistake, making it south-east ; while the Italian Museum MS.
has ostro (south),

Mr Marsden has not been able to find any account of this pe-330 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

wonder at is, that all the animals, sheep, oxen, and camels,
eat fish, because there is no grass, for it is the most
arid place in the world. These fishes are very small,
caught in March, April, and May, in wonderful quantities.
They are dried, lodged in houses, and given as food to
the animals during the whole year. The people eat them
also when quite alive and newly taken. There are also
plenty of large ones, which being made into a kind of
biscuit, by cutting them into small pieces and drying
them in the sun, are preserved under cover during the
whole year.* The incense, mentioned as so abundant,
is purchased by their lord at ten golden bezants the
cantar, and retailed to the merchants for forty, so that
he makes a very large profit. Let us now leave this city,
and tell you of Dufar.

XLI.—City of Dufar.

This is a beautiful, large, and noble city, 500 miles
south-west from Escier.t The people are Saracens,
adoring Mohammed, and ruled by a count, who is subject to Aden, to which, indeed, this city belongs. The

 

culiar species ; but the varieties of the sheep are numerous. One
reared in this arid country would of course be diminutive. The
want of ears would doubtless be suggested by the absence or
small size of the exterior appen: 5

* Extremely little is known of this coast; but in re; to
that on the Persian Gulf, which is exactly similar, Niebuhr and
Chardin fully confirm the copious supply of fish, and the practice
of feeding cattle with them. This, indeed, is a natural resource, where this food is so abundant, and vegetables so scanty.
On the opposite side of the gulf, where circumstances are similar, the same particulars are noticed by Arrian, in his Voyage
of Nearchus.

+ Dufar, or Dofar, is a well-known port in Arabia, and the
distance here stated (from the French) is just about the actual
one from Shaher. The other editions commit strange errors ;
the Crusca and Paris Latin have five, Ramusio twenty miles.
The direction is, as before, erroneous, doubtless from the same
cause, whatever that may be. This chapter is omitted in Pipino
and Grmeus 5 otherwise we may presume the right direction
would have been there given. Mr Wellsted, in his late survey,
found the district not very flourishing, with no port that could be
reckoned more than a village. Dofar, however, was the principal
one, surrounded by a well-cultivated country.—Vol. il. p. 453.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 331

port is very good, and merchants convey thence many
very fine Arabian horses, Numerous cities and castles depend upon it, and the country yields much incense. The
trees are about the size of a small fir, and incisions are
made with knives in various places, whence flows the
incense, which, indeed, through the great heat, often
runs out of itself. I shall now proceed to relate of the
Gulf of Calatu.

XLII—Gulf and City of Calatu.

Calatu is a large city within the gulf of the same
name, six hundred miles north-west from Dufar.* It
is a noble seaport, inhabited by Saracens, who are subject to Cormos. When the melik of that city is at war
with a more powerful prince, he retires to this place,
which is strong by nature and art, and finds himself
secure. The people have no grain but what they import.
Many ships bring the goods and spices of India, which
are distributed throughout the interior, and many fine
horses sent in return. But I must observe, that this
city is at the mouth of the Gulf of Calatu, so that the
melik can prevent vessels from sailing in or out without
hisconsent. This power he often uses against the sultan
of Creman ; for when that prince demands any exorbitant tribute from him or other vassals, they remove from
Cormos to Calatu, and allow no ships to pass, whence
the other prince suffers severely, and is obliged to abate
his demands. The people of this country live on dates

 

* This is Kalhat, near a cape of the same name, at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, on the western side. The distance
from Dofar here given (from the French) is correct ; in the
other editions it is absurd,—in the Paris Latin six, in Ramusio
fifty miles. The place has no longer Any existence and Mr
Marsden imagines it must have included Muscat, probably at
that time under its dependence ; but this is impossible, the two
sites being 100 miles distant. Mr Wellsted lately visited that of
Kalhat, and found it covered by extensive ruing, fully confirming that early splendour and importance which our traveller
ascribes to it. ly one mosque remained entire, and there
was a qual fishing-village to the north.—Travels in Arabia,
vol. i. p. 41.332 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN 8EAs,

and salt fish, which are abundant ; but many rich men
are well supplied with better food.

XLIII.—Return to Cormos.

After departing from Calatu, and sailing three hundred miles between north-west and north, you find the
city of Cormos ;* but if you take a direction from the
former place between north-west and north, and sail five
hundred miles, you come to Quis. However, we shall
pass over this last place, and speak of Cormos, a large and
noble capital, subject to a melik, who commands many
townsand castles. The people are Saracens, and adore
Mohammed. The heat is very great, on which account
every house is provided with ventilators placed on the
side whence the wind blows, which being thus admitted,
renders the mansion tolerably cool. We gave an account of this place formerly, as well as of Quis and
Creman, but have since made a circuit which brought
us back to it. However, we will say no more, but proceed now to the description of Great Turkey.t

 

* Ormus.—This vo was probably performed by Marco
himself, on his way from India to Persia ; and he is strictly
correct as to distance and direction. The latter is erroneous in
Ramusio,—north-east.

+ In the Crusea, it is said :—* In now returning, we will relate all the particulars that we had omitted.” This is more fully
expressed in Ramusio :—“ Before bringing the work to a conclusion, I shall step back and notice some regions lying towards
the north, which I omitted to speak of in the Preceding book.””
There is nothing of this in the ch, which I am persuaded is
here the genuine text, while the other editors have interpolated
their own ideas on the subject. The reader who pientively
peruses the following chapters will perceive that the groun
Rone over is by no means the same as formerly. Tartar king
ome and countries were indeed treated of, but these were
the east and north-east of Asia, the original seat of Mongol
power. We are now introduced to those in the centre and northwest of that continent. We have seen that the Poli, after landing in Persia, escorted the two princesses to Casan or Ghazan,
then commanding in Khorasan. I apprehend that the succeed
ing information 1s that collected during the residence there.
‘he following chapters will be chiefly new to the English
reader, and include an historical account of the most remarkable events in the history of central and north-western Asia,AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 333

XLIV.—Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu.

This country lies to the north-west as you go from
Cormos to the river Gihon, extending towards the terTitory of the great khan. It is governed by a nephew
(cousin) of his, named Kaidu, grandson of Ciagatai,*
brother to that monarch. He isa very powerful lord, ruling many cities and castles. His subjects are Tartars,
very able combatants, much inured to fighting, and he
does not obey the khan, but is rather at perpetual war
with him. This is because Kaidu demanded constantly
from that monarch a share of his conquests, particularly in Catai and Manji. The latter said he would
willingly grant it to him, as to his other descendants,
if he would come to his court and council whenever summoned. But the other, afraid to trust his uncle, offered

 

during the thirty years preceding. Marco has not appeared to
shine in reepont to the early Mongol history ; but we found reason to ascribe this to the ignerance prevalent at the court of Kublai. Ghazan, on thecontrary, wasa most accomplished and intelligent prince. He was the first who, by collecting the loose
traditions, formed a written history of Gengis and his successors
(Marsden, p. 198). De Snignce describes him as habitually
studying the t actions of Cyrus and Alexander, and striving to imitate them. He formed a body of institutes in regard
to all the branches of government, which are still observed in
Persia, and have been translated into English by Colonel Kirkpatrick (Malcolm’s History of Persia, vol. i. p. 438). There
seems ground, therefore, to suppose, that the information obtained from him respecting recent events and adjacent countries,
would be generally correct. .

Ramusio, hitherto so copious, has omitted all this historical
matter ; so that it is unknown to Mr Marsden, of whose learned aid the editor is thus deprived. Nor has he obtained much
from Count Boni, who has nearly confined his illustrations to
Ramusio’s text. He hopes, however, to prove, that the events
now narrated accord in their general outline with the most
authentic oriental histories. If there is a discrepancy respecting
some important details, it is not greater than is found in these
histories themselves ; and there may perhaps appear reason to
think that, in some instances, Marco’s statement is the most
correct yet given to the world. .

* According to Abulghasi, he was grandson to Ugadai or
Okkoday ; his father, named Kashi, having died of excessive
drinking. In either case, he will be cousin, not nephew, to
Kublai ; but our traveller is not very precise in these genealogical matters.334 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEA8,

to obey him where he was, but dreaded that if in his power
he would be put to death. Hence arose this discord, and
the khan drew his forces around the realm of Kaidu to
guard against an invasion; yet that prince contrived
to penetrate, and fought repeatedly with the armies
of Kublai; for he could bring into the field 100,000
brave and skilful horsemen. He had with him also
many lords of the imperial lineage. Each soldier carries to battle sixty arrows, thirty smaller for shooting,
and thirty larger, pointed with heavy iron, to throw
against the face or arms of the enemy, or cut the cords of
his bow; and when they have discharged all these, they
lay their hand on their swords, and strike most terrible
blows. Now, in the year 1266, this king, with his cousin
named Jesudar, assembled a very great army, and
marched against two barons that were also his relations,
but held their lands from the great khan. Kaidu and
his cousin fought with these two chiefs, who had also
a very large force, so that between them there were
100,000 horsemen. They contended hardly and long,
and many fell on both sides; but at last Kaidu conquered; however, the two barons, being well mounted, escaped without injury. The victor then became
still more proud and boastful; yet he returned home
and remained two years in peace. Then he assembled a mighty host of cavalry, having learned that at
Karakorum there was a great army under Nomogan, a
son of the khan, and George, a grandson of Prester
John. He marched thither with all speed, and the two
chiefs being informed of his approach, courageously prepared to meet him with their horsemen, amounting to
upwards of 60,000. Having reached the place where
his men were ranged in tents on the plain, they skilfully established their own camp. Each party rested and
made preparations for three days, when they advanced
to the combat. There was little advantage on either
side ; both having about 60,000 mounted men well armed
at every point, divided into six squadrons of 10,000.
They waited only till they heard their lord sound theAND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 335

maccar ; meantime performing loudly on various musical
instruments. At length the signal was given, when the
hosts rushed against each other, laying their hands on
their bows. The arrows filled the air like rain; men
and horses were mortally wounded ; noise and cries
arose so loud that the thunder of Jove could not have
been heard. Truly this was an evil hour for many, who
on both sides fell dead and dying. The arrows being discharged, they rushed on with sword and spear, giving and
receiving most dreadful blows. You might see arms and
hands cut off, and numbers of men rolling senseless on the
earth. Kaidu displayed signal prowess, and his soldiers
would have often been driven off the field, had he not
encouraged and rallied them. On the other side, the
two princes also firmly stood their ground, and it really
was one of the most cruel battles ever fought between
Tartar tribes. Yet though each strove with all his
might to discomfit the other, neither could succeed, and
the conflict lasted tillevening. On this fatal day, multitudes of men fell, many wives were made widows, children made orphans, and households filled with tears and
lamentations. But when the sun set, the struggle could
endure no longer, and both parties returned to their
camp overpowered with fatigue, happy to rest during the night. When morning dawned, King Kaidu,
having received intelligence that the great khan was
marching against him with a mighty host, deemed it
unsafe to remain longer. Wherefore he and all his
men mounted and rode off to their own country ; the
two princes were so exhausted, that they did not attempt
to follow, so that he with his people reached Samarcand,
the capital of his kingdom.*

 

* We have been already introduced to Kaidu as the relation
and imbittered enemy of Kublai. As he seems never to have
been recognised as a regular sovercign, the notices of him in
oriental history are extremely slight. De Guignes, however
(tome iii. p. 185-187), mentions his repeated inroads, and particularly his attempts to obtain possession of Karakorum, which
would have thrown great lustre on his arms. On occasion of
the principal conflict, he represents the army as commanded336 ‘VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

The great khan felt much wrath at Kaidu for committing such ravages, and bethought himself, that had
he not been his nephew, he would have seized his land
and put him to a cruel death; but regard to his own
flesh restrained him. Thus he escaped out of the hand
of the mighty monarch. But I have wonderful stories
to tell you about a daughter of this prince.

XLV.—Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu.

This young lady was in Tartar named Aigiarm, which
means in our language “ brilliant moon.” She
such strength that none of the youths or nobles in the
whole kingdom could vanquish her, but were all beaten.
Her father wished to marry her to a baron; but she
refused ever to unite herself to any one who could not
vanquish her in fair combat; and the king granted her
this privilege. She rejoiced greatly, and published
through various parts of the world, that if any gentle
youth would come, try her in pitched battle, and gain
the victory, she would accept him for her lord. This

 

by Bayam,the conqueror of Manji ; but Kublai, unjustly jealous of that officer, sent his grandson ‘Temur and another prince
to supersede him; yet before their arrival, he had gained
the victory. Our traveller, getting his information through
Kaidu, might be mistaken on this point. De Guignes represents the seat of that prince’s power as in igh, to the
north-east of Turfan, and among the tribes north of the Altai.
Marco, on the contrary, here distinctly states it as immediately north of the Oxus, and Samarcand as his capital, All
his particulars accord with this ; the distance of forty days’
journey to Karakorum ; the combination with Barak in
invasion of Khorasan, and the accidental but evident notice of
him in treating of Samarcand. Price, in fact, calls him (Keydu)
Khan of Turkestan, and mentions au inroad by him into Khorasan (Mohammedan History, vol. ii. p. 605). I am convinced,
then, Marco was right, and that the French writer merely,
from the repeated attempts against Karakorum, concluded that
his territory lay adjacent to that capital.

Kaidu continued thirty years powerful and formidable ;
but, in 1301, having been attacked by Temur, the successor
Kublai, he was defeated and died of grief, when his family submitted.—De Guignes, tome iii. pp. 194, 195,AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 337

news was spread wide through the surrounding countries, and I assure you many gentlemen came and made
the trial, which was arranged in the following manner.
The king, with many young nobles and ladies, assembled
in the great hall of the palace, when the princess entered
in a robe of cotton richly adorned, attended by youths
similarly attired. The agreement was, that if the candidate prevailed and threw her to the ground, he should
have her for his wife; but if victory declared on her
side, he was to give her a hundred horses. Thus she had
gained above ten thousand steeds, because she could
find no youth or damosel that could overcome her ; nor
was this wonderful, for she was large, tall, and wellformed in her limbs, indeed almost a giantess. Now,
about the year 1280, there came the son of a rich king,
an extremely handsome young man, with a brilliant retinue and a thousand very fine horses. He addressed himself to Kaidu, who was very desirous of marrying him
to his daughter. He therefore caused her to be privately
dealt with, to allow herself to be conquered; but she
declared she would not do so for any thing in the world.
One day then, the king and queen, with many nobles
and ladies, assembled in the great hall; the princess
and prince then entered, and their handsome appearance struck all with wonder; he was really so strong
and powerful, that no one else could contend with him.
When they were in the middle of the hall before this
great assembly, the agreement was formally made, that
the suitor, if vanquished, should lose his thousand horses.
But all the company, as well as the king and queen,
expressed their wishes that he should be successful.
The two then rushed together, and wrestled violently,
dragging each other in different directions: but at last
the lady prevailed, and threw him on the ground, to
the great grief of all the spectators; he thus forfeited
the thousand horses. But I have to inform you, that
Kaidu led this daughter to many battles, and in no encounter could any warrior withstand her. On many
orrasions, she rushed among the enemy, seized one of
¥338 §VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEA8,

the chiefs, and dragged him over to her own army.*
I will now, however, proceed to a great battle fought
between her father and Argon, the son of Abaga, lord of
the East.

XLVI.—Great Battle between Barak and Argon.

Abaga ruled many provinces bordering on those of
Kaidu, and it was where grows the tree called in the
book of Alexander the Arbor Secco.t As that prince
committed great ravages on his territory, he sent his
son Argon, with a very large host of cavalry, into the
country of the Arbor Secco, to the river of Gihon, where
he took a station fitted to guard the country against the
invader. Kaidu, however, assembled a great body of
horsemen, and gave the command to a brother named
Barak, very brave and skilful, desiring him to oppose
the enemy. Barak, with his troops, rode on till they
came to the river, and were ten miles distant from Argon.
The latter, informed of the approach of his adversary,
made diligent preparation ; the two remained three
days in their respective camps. When they were
fully prepared, and the naccar began to sound, they
no longer delayed, but rushed furiously against each
other. The arrows might be seen flying on all sides, and
the air was so full of them, that it seemed to rain; and
when both parties had discharged them, and many men
as well as horses had been slain, they seized their swords

* The editor is obliged to say, that he has in vain searched
the records of the East for any notice of this Herculean fair one ;
uor does Count Boni appear to have been more fortunate. But
our information respecting Kaidu himself is so excessively slight,
and only as connected with the history of Kublai, that we
could not reasonably expect any mention of an incident of this
merely domestic nature.

+ Abaga, in 1283, succeeded Hoolaku, the conqueror of Bagdad, as lord of the East, or “ of the Eastern Tartars,” a rule
which included the whole of Persia, with 8 of Sysia and
Asia Minor. He is described as a wise and able prince. We
have already observed, that the arbor secco means the planetree, considered characteristic of Khorasan, the most eastern

rovince of Persia, and one of vast extent, reaching from the
pian to the Oxus, called here Gihon.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 339

and spears, and began a most fierce and cruel combat.
Arms and legs were cut off, chargers killed, and many
dreadful wounds inflicted ; the noise and cries were such
as would have drowned the loudest thunder. I assure
you, in a few hours the ground was covered with dead
and dying. Finally, Barak and his men could not endure
the force of their adversary, and retreated across the
river ; while the victor pursued and killed a great number.* Thus Argon gained the day ; and having begun to
speak of him, I will relate his other adventures, and how
he became sovereign lord after the death of Abaga, his
father.

XLVII.—Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire

Not long after Argon had gained this battle, he received news of the death of Abaga. He was much
grieved, yet prepared with his whole host to return to the
court, and take possession of the sovereignty ; but he
had forty days to march before arriving there. Nowa
brother of the deceased monarch, named Acomat Soldan,
who had become a Saracen, having heard of the event,
bethought himself, that since the heir was so distant, he
himself might succeed. Having prepared a large body
of men, he marched directly to the capital, and seized the
supreme power. He found such an amount of treasure,
that it could scarcely be counted. He lavished his
bounty in a wonderful manner on the chiefs and barons,
who declared him a good master, liked him, and
wished for no other. He studied to be popular, and to
please all men; yet the action he had committed was

the invader Berrak Khan, the latter Berauk. They describe
the battle as having taken place near Herat, but differ from our
traveller in one important particular, representing Abaga himself as having commanded the army. Yet as Price recognises
Argon as having been in possession of the government o! 10rasan, there can be scarcely a doubt, that he would at least be

vile, and blamed by many. It was not long till he
learned that Argon was marching against him with a
very powerful force. He made no delay, nor showed
surprise, but actively summoned his barons and troops ;
and in a week he had assembled a numerous body of
cavalry, who all marched cheerfully against Argon, expressing their earnest desire to kill or take him.

Soldan Acomat having thus assembled 60,000 horsemen, set out and marched full ten days without interruption, when he learned that Argon, with an equal
force, was five days’ journey distant. He pitched his
camp and awaited the enemy in a large and beautiful
plain, which seemed well adapted for the combat. He
then summoned his people, and thus addressed them :—
“ My lords, you know how well I am entitled to succeed my brother, being son of the same father, and having
accompanied him in all his conquests. Because Argon
is son to Abaga, some think he ought to succeed ; but
with all due respect to them, I consider this unjust.
Even during my brother’s life, I was reasonably entitled
to half the kingdom, only through my mildness I allowed him the whole, but now I ought to succeed. I
pray you then to defend my right against Argon, and
preserve to us the rule; for I seek only the name and
dignity, and leave to you the profit and possession of all.
I need say no more to wise men, who love justice, and
will do all things for the general honour and benefit.”
‘When the barons, chiefs, and soldiers heard this speech,
they declared with one consent their resolution to adhere to him while they had breath, and defend him against
all, and particularly Argon, whom they trusted they
would capture and place in his hands.

When that prince learned that his rival was waiting for
him with so great a multitude, he was much discomposed ;
he considered, however, how injurious it would be to show
melancholy or fear, and the necessity of displaying valourand boldness. He sent for his lords and counsellors,
and having assembled a great number, thus addressed
them :—“ My dear brothers and friends, you know wellAND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 341

how tenderly my father loved you, regarding you while
he lived as kindred and children ; also how many great
battles you fought with him, aiding him to conquer all
his kingdom. Now I am the son of him who loved you
so much, and to me you are equally dear; I therefore
trust you will aid me against the man who seeks, contrary to all right and reason, to disinherit me. Consider
also, that he has forsaken our law and embraced that of
Mohammed ; it were fitting indeed that a Saracen should
rule over the Tartar nation! Therefore, friends and
brothers, I trust that you will willingly and heartily
support me, and that each will display such valour,
that the battle may be ours, and we may comfort ourselves by thinking that the right is on our side.” After
this speech, each lord and chief thought to himself, that
he ought rather to die than not strenuously endeavour to
gain atriumph. While the rest were silent, one great
lord arose and said :—‘“ Noble sire, we know fully the
truth of what you have said, and I will now answer in
the name of all now present, that while life remains in
our bodies, we are ready to die rather than fail to conquer. Victory, too, appears to us certain, since we are
so greatly in the right, and our enemies in the wrong.
I advise, then, that we march as soon as possible against
the foe, and pray all our companions to display such
valour, that their deeds may be spoken of over the whole
world.” That brave man having concluded, all present
assented, and eagerly desired battle. Next morning, Argon
and his troops began their march, riding towards the
plain on which their enemies were posted, and pitched
their camp ten miles distant from that of Acomat.
Argon now chose two intelligent men, in whom he
greatly confided, and sent them to his uncle. They
mounted on horseback, went direct, and alighted at the
pavilion of the soldan, whom they found with a numerous company of barons. Being well acquainted, they
saluted him courteously, and received a cheerful welcome. After some time, one of them rose and said,—
“Noble sire, your nephew Argon wonders greatly at342 VoYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN 8EA8,

your seizing his kingdom, and coming thus to fight
against him. This is not good conduct, nor due from
an uncle towards a nephew; he therefore courteously
prays you to abstain, and desiring neither war nor quarrel, will respect you as superior and father, both of himself and of the whole country.” Acomat answered,—
‘My lords messengers, my nephew is entirely mistaken ; the land is mine, I conquered it along with his
father. If he will consent, I will make him a great
lord, endowing him with spacious estates, treating him
as my son and the highest under myself; otherwise, be
assured, I will endeavour to put him to death.” The
envoys then asked repeatedly, if they could hope for
no other determination. He replied, never in his lifetime. They then departed, and rode to the camp of
their lord, alighted at the tent, and told him his uncle’s
declaration.* Argon was greatly enraged, and said aloud
in the hearing of all, that he would never live in comfort
till the whole world had seen the signal vengeance he
would take on his uncle. He said to his chiefs,—“ Now
let us without further delay march against these traitors
and endeavour to destroy them.” The night was spent
in busy preparation ; and Acomat Soldan, being warned
by his spies, was equally active.
XLVIII.—Great Battle between them.

Next day Argon, having made all his arrangements,
advanced in good order; while his antagonist, not waiting
his arrival, led on his troops to the encounter. They
soon met, and the two great hosts, who had much desired the battle, rushed without delay against each other.
Arrows flew like rain, chiefs fell to the ground, the
air resounded with the cries and lamentations of the
wounded and dying. Their arrows being exhausted, they
rushed on with swords and spears; arms, hands, and
heads were cut off, and the noise would have drowned
the loudest thunder, In that day many brave men

 

* The Paris Latin version terminates here abruptly, in the
middle of the narrative.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 343

died, and many ladies were left disconsolate. Argon
assuredly displayed great prowess, and set a gallant example ; but in vain,—fortune turned against him,—his
men, compelled to flee, were pursued and slain in great
numbers.. Among the fugitives, he himself was captured, when the pursuers stopped and returned with him
to their camp, rejoicing beyond measure. Acomat caused
him to be imprisoned and carefully guarded ; then, being of a voluptuous disposition, he returned to court to
enjoy the society of his numerous and handsome wives.
He instructed the commander of the host to guard the
captive as himself, and return at leisure that his troops
might not be fatigued. He then departed, while Argon
remained in chains, and so grieved, that death appeared
to him desirable.

XLIX.—Final Issue of the Contest.

Now there was a great and aged Tartar baron, who
felt much pity for the prisoner, and bethought him how
wicked it was to keep their lord in this condition. He
resolved, therefore, to attempt his deliverance. He argued to this effect with many other chiefs, who, esteeming his wisdom, and conscious that he spake the truth,
entirely agreed with him. Then Boga, who had made
the proposal, Elcidai, Togan, Tegana, Taga, Tiar Oulatai, and Samagar, all went to the tent of the captive
prince. The first, asthe eldest and the leader, addressed
him thus,—“ Noble prince, we are now fully sensible
of having acted wickedly towards you, and have determined to return to the right path; we will therefore
deliver and own you as justly our liege lord.” Argon,
who thought they were mocking him, was both grieved
and angry. “ My lords,” said he, “ you have done
wrong enough in seizing your sovereign and making
him a captive. Pray depart, and do not also make him
a subject of mockery.” “ Illustrious prince,” said Boga,
“ we positively speak the truth, and will make oath to
it according to our law.” Then all the barons swore
that they would obey him as their lord, while he in344 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN 8Ea8,

return bound himself in no degree to resent past wrongs,
but hold each of them as dear as Abaga his father had
done. They then freed him from his chains, and did
homage to him. He now ordered them to discharge their
arrows against the tent of the melic; and that chief,
named Soldan, who was the first after Acomat, and the
commander of the whole host, was quickly slain.
Finding himself thus lord of all, he gave orders to
march to the court, and was instantly obeyed. One day,
thereafter, when Acomat was holding a splendid festival
in his palace, a messenger came to him and said,—“ Sire,
I bring you with regret unwelcome tidings ; the barons
have delivered Argon, owned him as lord, and killed
Soldan your faithful friend. They are coming now with
their utmost speed to take and slay you.” He was then
silent, but the other was completely amazed and terrified.
However, as a bold and brave man, he ordered the messenger not to say a word to a living creature; then
mounting on horseback, set out with a few trusty servants, to seek refuge with the Sultan of Babylon, leaving all in ignorance whither he had gone. After marching six days, he came to the only pass by which he
could penetrate. The commander who guarded it knew
him, and seeing him fleeing with only a few adherents,
determined to seize him, Acomat entreated for mercy,
and offered a great treasure as the price of liberty ; but
the other, being greatly attached to Argon, replied that
the wealth of the world would not prevent his placing
him in his master’s hands. He prepared a large company, and set out with his captive, watching him so
carefully as to make escape impossible. They rode on
to the court, where Argon had arrived only three days
before, and been much vexed to find that his uncle had
escaped ; but when the guardian of the pass brought the
fugitive before his presence, he felt the greatest possible
joy. He received the latter sternly, telling him that
he would meet with the treatment he deserved; and
without asking any one’s advice, he commanded him to
be led forth and slain, This mandate was speedily exe-AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 345

cuted, and the body was thrown into a place where it
was never seen more.* Thus have you heard the whole
affair of Argon and of Acomat his uncle.

L.—Reign of Argon.

Argon was thus master of the palace andof the kingdom,
and the barons from every quarter came to render him
due homage and obedience. After governing some time,
he sent Casan his son with 30,000 men, to the country of the Arbor Secco, there to guard and secure his
land and people. Argon began his reign in the year
1286, after Acomat had ruled two years. The former,
after holding the sceptre six years, died, not without
strong suspicions of poison.t

 

* This train of events is related by all the oriental authorities, but with considerable variations both from each other and
from our author. D’Herbelot (voc. Argon) represents the
prince, after the election of his uncle, as fleeing into Khorasan,
then defeated, not by Ahmed (Acomat) in person, but by Alinak, his general; as not taken in battle, but fleeing to a
fortress, where that officer by fair promises induced him to
surrender, and then made him prisoner. His deliverance by
the Emir Bougha, and the other events, pretty closely agree.
The account given by De Guignes (tome iii. p. 264) is nearly
similar to the above. Haithon represents the sultan himself (called Mahomet ) as pursuing the prince into his mountainfortress, capturing and delivering him to be guarded by his
general. But Price (Mohammedan History, vol. ii. p. 578-582)
gives the most detailed and, it should seem, most carefully investigated narrative ; and it comes much closer to that of our
traveller. He confirms his possession of the government of
Khorasan, and the sultan having marched against him in Bee
son, but reports the prince as defeated by an idvanoe-quar of
15,000 men, and made prisoner by Alinak (Ally Eynauk). The
return of the sultan, the interview of Bouka with Argon, and
his surprise of the general’s tent, are related nearly as here.
Ahmed, however, is represented (not very probably) as refusing
to flee, and thus falling into the hands of his nephew, who delivered him to the sons of a chief whom he had killed, and who
speedily put him to death, Considering: these wide discrepancies in the best historical records, and the peculiar opportunities of Marco, I cannot think it at all improbable that his
narrative may come nearer to the truth than any other.

+ I do not observe these suspicions in any other narrative.
it does, however, appear, that Argon had become unpopular,
and his death was somewhat sudden. Ghazan, who viewed his346 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

LI.—Reign of Quiacatu.

When Argon was dead, his uncle, named Quiacatu,
brother to Abaga, immediately seized the throne, which
was easily effected, as Casan was distant at the Arbor
Secco. The latter, when informed of these eyents,
was much grieved at the death of his parent, and still
more incensed at Quiacatu having seized his inheritance.
He was afraid, however, to march at once against him,
but resolved, that at the proper time and place he would
take as signal vengeance as his father had done on Acomat.* Thus Quiacatu obtained general obedience, except
over the troops whom Casan immediately commanded.
He married the wife of Argon his nephew, and indulged
largely in the pleasures of the seraglio. At the end of
two years, however, his death ensued, being occasioned
by poison.t

LII.—Contest between Baidu and Ghazan.

Baidu, his uncle, and aChristian, then seized the sovereignty, and was generally obeyed, unless by Casan and
hisarmy. The latter, on learning these things, regretted
much that he had not been able to punish Quiacatu, but
determined to take such vengeance on Baidu, that the
world might admire it. He marched without delay against

 

successors in a hostile light, might be disposed to be jealous on
ihts subject.

* These feelings are not stated in the histories, and indeed,
under the circumstances, would doubtless be concealed ; but
they are highly probable, and likely to be communicated to the
Poli, with whom Ghazan was on so friendly a footing.

+ This prince occurred to us formerly under the name of Kaikhatu, as receiving the Poli and their two fair charges, on their
first arrival from China. He is characterized by De Guignes
(who calls him Kandgiatou), as irreligious, perjured, and debauched, yet ruling with justice. After displaying at first some
vigour, he abandoned himself to profligate habits, and so dis
sted the chiefs,that a general confederacy was formed against

im. His unpopularity rendered it impossible to make any
serious resistance; he was taken and put to death (De Guignea,
tome iii. p. 266. ice, vol. ii, p. 599-601). Poison was a very
likely mode of effecting this object ; though we do not find the
assertion made any where else.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 347

that chief, who, informed of his approach, assembled a
great force, and marched ten days’ journey to meet him,
when he encamped, and awaited his adversary, earnestly
exhorting and encouraging his troops. In two days Casan came up, and immediately a battle began, most bloody
and desperate ; but it was vain for Baidu to struggle,
since, as soon as the contest commenced, many of his
men went over and fought on the side of his opponent.
He was accordingly discomfited, and killed. Casan,
thus victorious, immediately marched to court and assumed the sovereignty, when all the barons paid him
homage and obedience ; and this was in the year 1294.*
Thus have you heard the whole train of affairs from
Abaga down to Casan. You must likewise know that
Alau, who conquered Bagdad, and was brother to Kublai,
was ancestor to all the princes now named ; for he was
the father of Abaga, grandfather of Argon, who was
the parent of Casan, now reigning. Having told you
all about these Tartars of the East, I might go on to
treat of Great Turkey ; but the truth is, I have done so
already, mentioning all the acts of Kaidu, so that I have
nothing more to say, and shall therefore now tell you of
the provinces and people that lie to the northward.

LIII.—Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom.

In this quarter isa king named Conci. He and all
his people are Tartars, and adhere to the rudest and most
brutal customs of that nation, never having changed
since the time of Gengis Khan.t They have a god of

 

* Baidu is stated in the histories to have been a grandson of
Hoolaku, in which case he must have been nephew, not uncle to
Kaikhatu ; but we have found our author before not very precise
upon these points. De Guignes and Price mention several negotiations between the two claimants ; but both agree with our
author, that the final downfal of Baidu was occasioned by the
union of the chiefs against him, and in favour of his rival, whose
more legitimate claim was already supported by a high repuseen ond allan talents.—De Guignes, vol. iii. p. 269. Price,

felt, named Nacigai, to whom they also give a wife,
calling these two lords of the earth, who guard all their
corn, beasts, and landed property ; and when they get
any victuals, they anoint with them the mouth of these
deities. The king is independent, being of the imperial
lineage of Gengis, and a near relation of the great khan.
He has neither cities nor castles, but his people reside
in vast plains, diversified with valleys and mountains.
They are very submissive to him, and he successfully
studies to preserve among them peace and union.* They
have no grain, but live on milk and cattle, which
abound, including camels, horses, oxen, sheep, and other
animals. There are also bears, white all over, and longer
than twenty palms, with foxes, large and black ; likewise
a great number of sables, whose costly skins I have
mentioned as worth each a thousand bezants. The rats
of Pharaoh are plentiful, and very large, affording food
to the people during the whole summer. In short, all
kinds of wild beasts abound in this savage and. trackless region. I must also mention, that this king has a
country in which horses cannot travel, on account of the
numerous lakes and fountains, and the quantity of ice
and mud. This rugged tract extends thirteen days’
journey, and at the end of each is a post-house to accom
modate the messengers, with about forty dogs, almost as
large as asses, to convey them from one post to the other.
As wheeled carriages cannot travel here, they employ
sledges, so formed as to move over the surface without

a body of troops to his son Scheibani, who established himself
on the mountains of Arall (Ural), and thence extended his dominion over Siberia. The name here given does not occur in
the list of its princes ; yet De Guignes mentions Conzi as one
of the sons of Scheibani. Ramusio, after omitting ths pre

sinking ; such, indeed, as are used in this country to convey hay and straw when there is great rain and mud. On
the sledge is spread a bear’s skin, whereon the messenger
sits, and the dogs drag it direct to the following post. The
guardian mounts a similar carriage, and guides him by
the best and nearest way. At the next post, they find
another relay of sledges and dogs, and the one which
conveyed them returns. The men dwelling in this wild
country are very expert hunters, capturing many precious
little animals, such as sables, ermines, and black foxes,
whose skins yield a large profit. They have engines so
well contrived that no animal can escape. But owing
to the extreme cold, all their habitations are under
ground.* Having nothing more to mention, we shall
depart and treat of a place where there is perpetual
twilight,
LIV.—The Region of Obscurity.

You must know, that beyond this kingdom is a province called Obscurity, because there never appears either
sun, moon, or star; but it is always dark, as with us
during twilight.t The people have no ruler, but live
like brutes. The Tartars, however, make occasional in
 

* To those at all acquainted with Siberia, it need scarcely be
remarked how very accurate is the description here given both
of its pastoral and frozen regions ; the beautiful furs ; the white
or polar bear; the sledges drawn by large dogs; the subterraneous habitations.

the sun is invisible, and the atmosphere is obscured, as it ap

le adds afterwards, “ the inhabitants take advantage of the
summer season, when they enjoy continual daylight, to catch,”
&c. These statements are in no early edition, and I cannot
help thinking that they betray the additional information derived from voyages performed long after into the northern
regions. The Crusca goes very far, representing the darkness
as complete, and the night perpetual ; a statement which dismays Count Boni, and arose probably from some misunderstanding of the original. L inclinetothink the French the most correct, and that the constant twilight mentioned arises rather
from dense fogs on the shores of the northern ocesn, than from
the position on the earth’s surface.350 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

roads in the following manner:—They ride on mares that
have just brought forth foals, which last are left at the
border. They then traverse the country, plundering
whatever they can find ; and when they wish to return,
the mares, seeking to find their young, know the way
better than the riders.* The people are all hunters, and
take. great numbers of sables, black foxes, and other
animals with costly furs. Those on their frontier meet
them at a fixed period, purchase these skins, and sell
them elsewhere with an ample profit. These people are
tall and well made, but pale and colourless. The territory borders on one side upon Great Russia, of which I
shall now proceed to speak.

LV.—Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries.

Russia is a very great province towards the north,
inhabited by Christians, who follow the Greek Church.
They have languages of their own, and several kings.
They are a very simple people, but extremely handsome, with a faircomplexion. The entrances and passes
into it are very strong ; they own some small allegiance
to the Tartar king of the West, named Toctai. The
country yields few commodities, except an abundance
of the furs already described, equal to any in the world.
There are considerable silver mines. But now let us
leave it, and describe the Greater Sea, with the provinces
around. But first let me tell you of a province lying
between north and north-west, and bordering on Russia,
named Lac, inhabited by a mixture of Christians and
Saracens, and subject to a king. The people carry on
merchandise and manufactures, and have a vast variety
also of valuable furs.t But now I must go back to

 

. _* There is no modern record of such predatory inroads, but
the country has been long held by Russia, a civilized and
powerful government, which would not permit such lawless
proceedings. Neither is there any other mention of this curious
mode of finding their way back ; but, no doubt, under these circumstances, the animals would trace it better than the riders.
_ + Count Boni thinks Lac (Lacea, Crusca) to be Poland, the
inhabitants of which, he says, own Lech for their progenitor.

Russia, and mention something that I had forgot. It
is so very extensive as to reach the ocean, where are
isles on which pilgrim-falcons and gerfalcons are found,
and carried to various parts of the world. Now from
Russia to Oroech is no great distance ; but the extreme
cold renders the journey very difficult.* This would
be the time to speak of the Strait of Constantinople and
the mouth of the Great Sea; but on considering that
many others have written on the subject, we shall omit
them, and proceed to treat of the Tartars of the West,
and the lords by whom they are ruled.

LVI.—Succession of Western Tartar Princes.

The first lord of these Tartars was Sain, a very great
and powerful king. He conquered Russia, Comania,
Alania, Lac, Mengiar, Zic, Gucia, and Gazaria. The inhabitants had all been Comanian ; but having no unity
or connexion, lost their country, and were driven into
various parts of the world, while those who remained
became servants of this conqueror. After him reigned
successively Patu, Barka, Mungletemur, Totamongur,
and Toctai, the present sovereign.t Having thus re
 

Yet, though Poland was well known in that age, and traversed,
as we have seen, by contemporary travellers, this name is never
found applied to it. It is stated, too, to be partly inhabited by
Saracens (Mohammedans), which might, it is said, refer to
Baatu’s expedition ; but his troops were not Mussulmans, and
they retired in a body, leaving not one behind. The Count’s
version (the Crusca) wants the sentence about Constantinople,
whence the position W.N.W. appears to be from Russia ; ébut
this is here supplied from the French, and if genuine, Lac must
bear that direction from the imperial capital. I incline to think
it Moldavia and Bessarabia, not then subject to Russia, and to
which Mohammedans might have penetrated.

* In the Crusca, it is Orbeche, in the Pucci, Osbech ; whence
Count Boni supposes it to mean the Uzbeks. ‘The French editor,
however, has in the margin Norvége (Norway), with which
suggestion I incline to concur. The country seems spoken of
as one known to Europeans; while the other would be too
distant. Neither Lac nor Oroech are in Ramusio ; so that we
have no aid from Mr Marsden. . .

+ This list is tolerably correct, if we except a great error at
the outset, by which Sain and Patu (Baatu) are represented as352 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

counted the kings of the Western Tartars, I will now
describe a great battle fought between Alau, lord of
the East, and Barka, lord of the West, with the occasion
which led to it.

LVII.—Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku.

You must know that about the year 1261 there arose
a great discord between these two monarchs. It was
about a province on their respective frontier which each
desired and would not yield, but resolved to seize it
and see who would oppose him. Thereupon they declared war, summoned their respective subjects, and
made the greatest preparation almost ever known. I
assure you, in six months each had assembled full 300,000
horsemen, well provided with every warlike implement.
Alau, lord of the East, then set out with all his troops,
and having rode many days, reached a wide plain between the Iron Gates and the Sea of Sarain. There he
pitched his camp, which, I have heard, contained many
rich tents, and made a splendid appearance. Being here
on the frontier, he resolved to wait, and see if Barka
would come. That prince having completed his preparations, and learned the approach of his foe, without
delay began his march. He rode on till he came to
the great plain where his enemy was posted, and pitched his camp at ten miles’ distance. I declare to you, it
was fully as beautiful as that of Alau, filled with tents
and pavilions of cloth of gold. Hisarmy, too, was more

same great warrior, with whom our readers must now be
pretty ‘well acquainted. De Guignes, tome i. p. 287, calls him

atou Sain; Abulghasi, p. 195, Batu Sager. The appellations, however, are so strikingly dissimilar, that we cannot
much wonder at their being considered applicable to different
Bereons, De Guignes’ list is as follows :—Batou Sain died in

256 ; Bereke, 1266; Toudan Mangou, 1287 ; Toulabouge, 1291;
Toghtagou (called by the Russians Toctais), 1313. 6 subsequent names, with the usual variations, agree with those of our
author, except in the absence of Tolobuga ; but he will come
in our way again, when we shall have occasion to make some
curious observations respecting him.j

AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 353

numerous, amounting, without a lie, to 350,000 horsemen.* They rested two days in their tents, when Barka
thus addressed his men :—“ Noble chiefs, you know
how, since coming to the sovereignty, I have loved you
as brothers and sons; you have accompanied me in
many great battles, and aided in conquering much territory. Alau, a great and powerful prince, proposes
wrongfully to fight against us; but having the right on
our side, we may confidently expect to conquer, especially since our army is more numerous. In this confidence, then, noble chiefs, and having come so far for
battle, let us prepare in three days to engage, arranging
so wisely, and displaying such valour, that our fame
may spread over the world.” He was then silent ; and we
must now return to his antagonist, who, when he heard
of his adversary’s arrival with so great an army, assembled his principal men and said :—“ Noble brethren and
friends, you have throughout all my life supported and
aided me, enabling me to conquer in many battles; nor
indeed ever fighting one in which we were not victorious. We have come here to combat the great Barka,
who indeed has as many and even more troops ; but ours
are braver, and I feel confident of victory. I rejoice,
then, to hear by the spies, that he is coming to give us
battle in three days, and I expect every one to be well
prepared, with his accustomed bravery, rather to die on
the field with honour, than to suffer disgrace and discomfiture.”

LVIII.—Great Battle between them.

On the appointed day Alau rose early, summoned his
men to arms, and ranged them very skilfully in order of
battle. He formed thirty squadrons, each containing
10,000 horsemen, making in all the number of 300,000,

 

* These numbers are no doubt exaggerated ; but this I aus

with able leaders and captains. By his order his
squadrons then advanced at a moderate pace over the
plain, till they arrived mid-way between the two camps,
where they stopped and awaited the enemy. On the
same morning, Barka similarly arranged his men, forming thirty-five squadrons of 10,000 each, with good
officers and commanders. He then made his troops ride
forward to within half a mile of the enemy, when
they halted, and again proceeded till the hosts, being
within two bow-shots of each other, stopped and arranged their squadrons. The plain was the largest
and finest in all that country ; which, assuredly, was
very necessary to afford a field of battle for such mighty
armies, amounting to 650,000 men. Indeed Alau and
Barka were the most powerful princes in the world, and
were near relations too,—being both of the imperial
lineage of Gengis Khan.

The two great kings with all their troops being thus
marshalled, impatiently waited for the naccar as a signal
of battle. When it sounded, the armies rushed forward
and discharged arrows against each other. The air was
filled, and the sky became invisible; numbers of men
and horses fell to the earth, which was covered with dead
and dying. The arrows being exhausted, they struck
dreadful blows with swords and spears ; assuredly there
had not for a long time been a battle in the world
fought by such numerous armies. Alau, most brave and
powerful in arms, showed himself this day worthy of
ruling a kingdom and wearing a crown. He displayed
signal prowess in his own person, and by his example
infused extraordinary courage into his men. His
achievements, indeed, astonished both friends and enemies ; he appeared, not aman, but thunder and tempest.
Barka, too, fought most bravely, and made himeelf
worthy of the admiration of the whole world ; but it
was all in vain ; his men were either killed, or so overwhelmed and exhausted, that they could endure no
longer. When evening arrived, they fied with their
utmost speed. The victor and his troops rapidly pur-AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 335

sued, and after committing dreadful slaughter returned,
threw aside their arms, and had their wounds washed and
dressed. They were, indeed, quite overpowered and
exhausted. The night was spent in repose, and next
day he ordered all the dead bodies both of friends and
enemies to be burned. He then returned into his country with all the troops who survived the battle; for I
assure you, although he conquered, he had lost a vast
number, yet still more had fallen on the opposite side.*
Having told you thus of Alau and his victory, we shall go
on to treat of a battle between the Tartars of the west.

* This war is narrated in all the oriental histories ; yet it
must be confessed with very wide variations. D’Herbelot
(voc. Abaka) and De Guignes (tome iii. pp. 258, 259) mention
no hostilities till after Hoolaku had been succeeded by Absga,
who sent his son Schamat to Derbend against Barka. it

rince is said to have gained a signal victory, which did not,

jowever, prevent his opponent from speedily returning with an
immense force; but death put an end to his further proceedings.
Yet these writers incidentally notice, that some years before
Barka had formed an alliance with Egypt, and carried on operations which had led to severe losses on the side of Syria.
Haithon of Armenia (Purchas, vol. iii. p. 117), whose local position makes him a good authority, states Hoolaku as personally
engaged in a great battle against Barka. Mr Price relates @
series of transactions conducted by that prince, who, after several
encounters near Schamachie, on December 1564, surprised and
defeated Barka, who then retreated. The army pursued ; but,
through want of caution, allowed themselves to be in their turn
sarpriee ;.and, while retreating across the Terek, the ice broke
and a number were drowned. But the date is 1264, three years
later than our author’s. Now Price mentions that Barka commenced his invasion in 1260, but that no steps were taken to
check it till 1264 (Mohammedan History, vol. ii. p. 571). We
cannot but think this very improbable, and that there must be
here a blank in oriental history, which, indeed, respecting all
this series of events, is extremely defective. This would be
supplied by the present narrative, which represents Hoolaku,
as might be expected, marching immediately against the invader,
and giving him so severe a repulse as might make him discontinue all operations till 1264, when he might return with recruited strength,

of the Tartars was named Mongutemur, and he was suoceeded by Tolobuga, a very young man. Tofimangu,
a powerful chief, aided by a king named Nogai,* killed
that prince and succeeded to the sovereignty. He
died, however, soon after, and in his room was elected
Toctai, a very wise and able chief. Meantime, two sons
of the slain monarch having grown up to manhood,
and being wise and prudent, assembled a large body of
troops, and marched to the court of Toctai. They went
and threw themselves on their knees before him, when

 

sion, but not in any other printed one, nor in any manuscript to which we have had access, except the Italian in the
Museum. A question may therefore be raised as to their genuineness. Besides, however, the high character of the edition,
the style is exactly the same, though the statements are somewhat more loose and careless ; but, indeed, they have been so
during several preceding chapters. The outline of the information is confirmed, as elsewhere, by oriental authorities.
We have pointed out the motives which led transcribers and
translators to the system of abridgment by simple omission, and
how these became always stronger as the work drew to its
close. The different editions, accordingly, have been dropping
off one after another ; and only the Crusca comes down to the
present point. There is also an Italian MS. in the Royal Library at Paris, which, from the list of names published by the
Geographical Society (p. 552), appears todo so. The Italian
MS. in the Museum, besides containing an abridged narrativeof
the succeeding events, affords a strong corroboration of their
haying been included in the original narrative.

* De Guignes gives an account of the rise of the d: or
Nogai (whom he calls Nogaia), and from whom probably s
numerous tribe of Tartars derive their appellation. ing employed with a strong force to keep in check certain northern
tribes, he threw off the yoke of his master, and having married
a natural daughter of the Emperor Michel Paleologus, assumed
the title and rank of a sovereign. This author agrees in making
him accessory to the murder of Tolobuga ; but he represents
Toctai as his accomplice, and thereb laced on the throne, making Totamanga the predecessor of the murdered prince. On
this subject, however, see the next note. That Toctai might
become the bitter enemy of the person who had raised him to
the throne is not without example in the annals of ambition ;
yet our author’s account seems the more probable one. The
two princes could never have come to solicit redress for their
father’s death from him who wasits chief author. De Guignes,
it is true, haa no such incident ; but there seems difficulty in
supposing it to be a complete fiction.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 357

he bid thefn welcome, and desired them to rise. The
two youths then stood up, when the eldest began to
speak thus :— Noble sire, we come as sons of Totamangu, who was killed by Tolobuga and Nogai.* The
former being dead, we can say nothing ; but we seek
vengeance on Nogai, and pray that you, as his rightful
lord, make him appear and account for the death of our
father.” The youth was then silent, and Toctai, feeling that he had spoken truth, replied,—* My noble
friend, I will willingly do what you ask.” He then
sent two messengers with this injunction to Nogai, who
laughed at it, and positively refused to come. They rode
back and reported this answer, when their master, much
enraged, said in the hearing of all around him,—“ If
God aid me, either Nogai shall obey my mandate, or I will
march with all my men to destroy him.” He then sent
two other messengers, who rode to the court of the Tartar,
presented themselves, and saluted him, He bid them

 

* I am obliged to notice here a gross ineonelstenoy in the
French text. Before, it was Totamangu who killed Tolobuga ;
now it is the reverse ; and this second version is carried through
the whole succeeding narrative. According to it, the order of
the sovereigns will saree with De Guignes, who places Totamangu first ; and as this order is given in two different parts of
his work, drawn from different authorities, it is probably correct (vol. i. p. 287 ; tome iii. PP; 346, 347). ‘Phe transition in the
original is curiously made :— Or avint qe endementier deus
filz de Tolobuga ge occis avoit esté, furent creu et estoient homes
qe bien pooient porter armes. ii estoient sajes e provens :
cesti deus freres, ce furent les fils de Totamangu.” I cannot
but suspect that this is a rough way of acknowledging his error,
and taking up the real state of the case. The Museum MS. indeed carries out through the whole the first statement of Tolobuga as the murdered prince, and his sons as seeking redress.
The French, however, is undoubtedly the earliest version, and
the Italian transcriber, on seeing the discrepancy, might naturally seek to remove it by continuing the first statement, supposing it the most correct. There appears reason to think that
the contrary i the truth ; an opinion which seems farther confirmed b’ Guignes’ report (tome iii. pp. 346, 347), that Tolobuge nearly usurped the supreme power even in the lifetime
of Totamangu, who, unable to control his turbulent chiefs, resigned the crown. This is not very far from the statement of

farco ; for in such a society, the abdication of a monarch and
his death were not likely to be very distant.358 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAS,

welcome, when one of them said,—* Noble sire, Toctai
gives warning, that unless you come to his court to account
for your conduct to the sons of Totamangu, he will march
against you with all his people, and do you all the injury
in his power ; therefore be careful what you do in this
business, and what message you send.” The other wrathfully replied,—* Gentlemen, return to your lord, and
tell him from me, that I little dread the threatened
war, and am ready to come and meet him half-way.”
The messengers, on hearing this speech, without delay
set out, and rode till they came to their master, and
told him all that Nogai had said. Seeing that war was
inevitable, he immediately sent his messengers to all his
subjects, and summoned them to prepare and march
against his adversary. And what shall I say! He assembled the greatest armament in the world. When the
Tartar prince heard this, he also made great preparations ;
but his people being less numerous, he could not assemble
an equal army; however it was very powerful.

When Toctai was fully ready to take the field, he set
out, leading with him, I assure you, two hundred thousand horsemen. He rode on to the large and beautiful
plain of Nerghi, and there pitched his camp. Hither also
came the two sons of Totamangu, with a noble company of men, to avenge the death of their father. Now
jet us turn to Nogai, who on learning his approach set.
out with all his troops, and, without doubt, they were upwards of 150,000 horsemen, all good and valiant, better
men at arms than those of the enemy. Two days after,
he arrived and pitched his camp at ten miles distance.
On both sides were seen very rich tents and pavilions of
cloth of gold, fully displaying the wealth of these kings.
They then waited a short time on the plain for refreshment and repose..

LX.—Great Battle.

Toctar now assembled his people, and spoke as follows :—“ My lords, we have come to fight King Nogai, and with great reason, since all this feud and enmityAND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 359

have arisen from his not coming to account for his conduct
to the sons of Totamangu. Since then his behaviour is
thus unreasonable, we must feel good courage and hope
of conquest ; and I earnestly pray that each man be valiant, and strive to carry destruction and death among the
enemy.” The other, too, thus addressed his men :—
‘ Noble friends and brethren, you know how many great
and hard battles we have gained, and against better men
than now oppose us; therefore you may feel assured of
victory. Besides, we are fully in the right, and he in
the wrong ; for, as you know well, he is not my lord,
nor entitled to call me to his court to give an account to
others, I say no more, but pray every one to perform
such exploits, that the whole world may admire them,
and your name may always strike terror.” The two
kings, having thus spoken, made no delay in forming
their order of battle. The first drew out twenty squadrons, and his enemy fifteen, of 10,000 men each, with
good captains and conductors. Having rode on to within
bow-shots, and the naccar having sounded, they rushed
forward and discharged their arrows, when many horses
and riders fell dead, loud cries arose, and tears were
shed. Afterwards they all advanced with sword and
spear ; hands, heads, and arms were cut off ; knights fell
dead and wounded to the earth ; the cries, noise, and clashing of arms, would have drowned the loudest thunder.
Never almost was there a battle in which such numbers
fell ; but the greater loss was on the side of Toctai, for
his adversary had better men-at-arms. The two sons of
Totamangu displayed great prowess, striving to the utmost to avenge the death of their father; but it was in
vain. The battle, in short, was most bloody and dreadful; many who in the morning were alive and vigorous,
during the day fell slain, and many happy wives were
made widows. Toctai strove with all his might to support his people and his honour, and displayed indeed a
prowess worthy to be praised by the whole world. He
rushed amid the enemy like one that cared nothing for
life or death, striking to right and left, rescuing his360 VOYAGE THROUGH THE INDIAN SEAs8,

people when seized or taken. He did much injury that
day both to enemies and friends; of the one he killed a
vast number, and the other, from his example, derived
boldness to push against their foe, and thus met instant
death. Nogai, on his side, equally acted the hero; he
rushed among theenemy asthe lion does among other wild
beasts, casting down and killing all whom he encountered. He threw himself among the thickest of the foe, and
all fled before him like weak and timid animals. His
troops emulated his valour ; but why make a long story !
The people of Toctai did every thing possible to support
their honour, though in vain, for they had too good
and stout men to deal with. They had suffered so much
as to make it evident that if they remained they would
all perish. They therefore took to flight as quickly as
they could, the victor with his troops pursuing and killing them in great numbers. Thus have you heard how
Nogai gained the battle, and be assured there died in it
60,000 men ; but the other king escaped, as well as the
two sons of Totamangu.*

LXI.—Conclusion.

You have now been informed of all the actions of the
Tartars and Saracens, of their customs, and of other
countries throughout the world, so far as they could be
searched out and discovered. We have only declined
saying any thing of the Black Sea and the surrounding
provinces, although we fully explored them, because it

 

* De Guignes relates the events of this war, but, as already
observed, he does not introduce the two princes, sons of Totamangu or Tolobuga, but represents Toctai as impelled merely
by jealousy of his neighbour or vassal, and a determination to
humblehim. There is astill more serious discrepancy ; for, instead of representing Nogai as victorious, he reports him as defeated and killed. Yet it isremarkable, that in another part of
his work he mentions him, on the authority of Abulfeda, as having lived many years after, and died only in 1299. He notices
himself the variation of the two accounts, but does not seem
able to say which is right. We confess ourselves equally at a
Joss ; but it would be hard to decide against our author on such
varying authority.AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN ASIA. 36]

would seemingly have been useless, and a repetition of
what others relate every day. The Venetians, the Genoese, the Pisans, and many other nations, are continually navigating it, so that every one knows the bordering countries. You have been informed in a chapter at
the beginning, of our departure from the great khan,
and the trouble and solicitation which Maffio, Nicolo,
and Marco had in obtaining his permission. You have
learned also the accident whereby it was procured,
without which we should have found it very difficult to
return into our country. But I believe it was the pleasure of God, that they might make known the great
things that are in the world, and, as formerly declared
in the preface, there never was a man, either Christian
or Saracen, or Tartar or Pagan, who explored so much
of the world as did Marco, the son of Nicolo Polo, that
noble and great citizen of Venice.* DeoGratias. Amen,
Amen.

 

* This concluding address is given by Count Boni from the
Crusca and Pucci editions, where alone it occurs, and with
some variation of language. Considering how the other editions
have dropped off before coming to this point, we cannot wonder
at its absence in any of them except the French, which stops
abruptly at the close of the preceding chapter. is circumstance, though difficult to account for, seems insufficient to make
us reject a passage supported by two such valuable editions.
We may observe a curious ch: in the last sentence, from the
first tothe third person. This, 1 apprehend, arises from Rusti
cians first writing as an amanuensis, then beginning in his own
person, when he pronounces 5 pene ic upon ), Which
would not have come very gra ly from the traveller himself.
