Mosul is a great kingdom on the eastern border of Armenia, and inhabited by various denominations of men, whom I will now describe. There is a race called Arabic, who adore Mohammed ; also another who hold the christian law, but not as the church of Rome commands ; they err in many things. They are denominated Nestorian and Jacobite, and have a patriarch named Jatolior, who makes archbishops, bishops, abbots, and other clergy, and sends them to all parts of Bagdad, India, and Cathay, as the pope does from Rome. All the Christians who are in those parts are of this sect ; and all the cloths of silk and gold, which are called mosulin, are made there. I tell you, too, that the great merchants who are called mosulin, and bring the largest quantity of all costly spices, are of this kingdom. Among its mountains are people called Kurds, who are Nestorian and Jacobite Christians, but some are Saracens, and reverence Mohammed. They are an overbearing and wicked people, ever ready to rob the merchants.Now let us leave Mosul, and speak of the great city of Baldach.
