You must know there are two Armenias, a great and a lesser one, which last has a king who rules with pure justice, and is subject to the Tartars. This region contains many cities and castles, and abundance of all things, with beasts and birds for hunting and hawking ; but I must tell you the. air is not very healthy. The gentry used formerly to be valiant and good at arms ; but now they are mean and yile, and remarkable only for being hard drinkers. On the seacoast is a city named Laias,which carries on a very great trade ; for thither all the spices, rich cloths, and other precious articles, are brought from India across the Euphrates, which the merchants of Venice, of Pisa, and of Genoa, come to purchase. . By this town we enter the province of Turcomania.
