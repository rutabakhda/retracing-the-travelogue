When you depart from Angaman, and sail. about a thousand miles westward, a little to the south, you reach the island of Seilan,the very best of its size in the world. It is 2400 miles in circuit ; yet I must tell you that anciently it was larger, being 3600, as appears by the old maps of the mariners on that sea ; but the north wind blows with such violence, that a great part has been carried away by the water.[ The people have a king called Sendemain, and are tributary to none ; they are idolaters, and go quite naked, except a small covering round the middle. They have no grain but rice, living on it and on flesh. I will now describe the most precious thing in the world; for here are noble and beautiful rubies, which can be procured nowhere else ; also the sapphire, the topaz, the amethyst, and various other precious stones. The king has the most beautiful ruby that ever was or can be in the whole world. It is the most splendid object on earth, and seems to glow like fire; it is of such value as money could scarcely purchase.The great khan sent his messengers to him, wishing to buy it, and offering the value of a city. The monarch replied, that he had received it from his ancestors, and would for no earthly consideration part with it. The people are not menat-arms, but unwarlike and cowardly ; when they need soldiers in war, they send for those of another country, commonly for Saracens.
