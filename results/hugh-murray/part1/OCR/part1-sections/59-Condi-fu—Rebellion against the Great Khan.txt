In departing from Cian-gli, we come in six days to Condi-fu,a great city, which the khan conquered by force of arms, but still it is the noblest in the province.t There is a wonderful abundance of silk, as well as orchards with many delicate fruits, and the situation is delightful ; it has also under it fifteen other cities of great importance and commerce, whence it derives high honour and dignity. In the year 1273, the khan gave to Litan, one of his barons, 70,000 horse to defend and secure that city; but when the said baron had remained some time in the country, he arranged with certain men to betray it, and rebel against his lord. ‘When the khan knew this, he sent two of his commanders, Aguil and Mongatai, with many troops, against the traitor. On their approach, the rebel went forth to meet. them with his forces, consisting of a hundred thousand cavalry and many infantry, both of the country and of those he had brought with him ; and there wasa very great battle between him and those two chiefs. Litan was killed, with many others; and the khan caused all those who had been guilty to be put to death, and spared the lives of the rest.Now let us tell of another country named Sin-gui.
