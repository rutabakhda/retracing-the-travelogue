We will now leave this city, and not go on to India, for I will describe it farther on in my book, in the proper time and place. We will return, therefore, by another road to Creman, because the countries now to be delineated can be reached only by way of that city, and I must tell you that Ruemedan Achomac, of whom we have just spoken, is subject to its king. The route in returning thither from Cormos is through avery fine plain. There are many springs whence the water issues in a hot state, forming baths very salutary in cutaneous and other diseases. Here is abundance of fruits and dates, also of partridges and other birds ; but the wheaten bread, owing to the quality of the water, is so bitter that no one unaccustomed to its use can eat it. I now wish to tell you of a country lying to the north. ‘When a man has left Creman, he travels seven days in that direction, through a very dreary region. During three days he finds no river, and the little water met with is salt, green like grass, and so bitter that it is impossible to drink it, and if a man tastes even a drop, it produces violent purging. Travellers, therefore, carry water with them ; but-the beasts being obliged to drink such as they find, suffer severely. The whole tract is an arid desert, destitute of animals, which could not find food. On the fourth day, you reach a river of fresh water, but with its channel mostly under ground. In some spots, however, the force of the current makes abrupt openings, when the stream appears for a short space, and drink is abundantly supplied. Then follows another tract that lasts four days, and is also a dry desert, with bitter water, and no animals except wild asses, At the end of the four days, we leave the kingdom of Creman and proceed towards Cobinam.
