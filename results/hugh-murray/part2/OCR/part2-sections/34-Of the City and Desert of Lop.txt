Lop is a large city at the entrance of the great desert bearing its name, and lying between the east and northeast. It belongs to the khan, and the people adore Mohammed. You must know that those persons who wish to pass this tract rest in the city a week to refresh themselves and their cattle ; then, having taken a month’s provisions and provender, they enter upon the desert, which I assure you is so extensive that if a man were to travel through its whole length, it would employ a year ; and even at its smallest breadth, a month is requisite.t It consists altogether of mountains and valleys of sand, and nothing is got to eat; but after travelling a day and a night, you find sweet water sufficient for from fifty to a hundred men, with their animals. A larger body could not be supplied. Thus, water is seen daily, or altogether in about twenty-eight places, and except in three or four it is good. Beasts or birds there are none, because they could not find food; but there is agreat wonder which I must now tell you. When a party rides by night through this desert, and any one lags behind, or straggles from his companions through sleep or any other cause, when he seeks to return to them, he hears spirits speak to him in such a manner that they seem to be his comrades, and they frequently call him by name, and thus lead him out of his way so that he never regains it, and many persons are thus lost and perish. I must tell you, too, that even by day you hear these voices of spirits, and even tambours, and many other instruments sounding.They find it necessary, also, before going to rest at night, to fix an advanced signal, pointing out the course to be afterwards held ; likewise to attach a bell to each of the animals, that they may be more easily kept from straggling. In this manner, amid much danger and fear, this desert is passed. Now we must tell you of the countries that lie on the other side.
