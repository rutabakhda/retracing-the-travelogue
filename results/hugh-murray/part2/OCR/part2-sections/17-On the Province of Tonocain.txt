‘When a man departs from Cobinam, he goes through a desert of eight days, and the country is very arid; there is neither fruit nor trees, and the water is bitter and bad, so that he must carry both it and food for himself, but the beasts drink that on.the road, though very unwillingly. He then comes to a province called Tonocain, with cities and many castles, bordering upon Persia towards the north; and there is a very great plain on which grows what the Christians call the dry tree, which I will describe to you. It is very large, and its leaves are green on one side and white on the other. It yields a nut like the chestnut ; but there is nothing within it. It is a strong wood, and yellow like box ; and there is no other tree in those parts for a hundred miles round, except on one side, at ten miles’ distance.It is said by the people of the country to be the place where Alexander fought with Darius. There are many towns and castles, and the inhabitants have abundance of all good things, the climate being neither too cold nor too hot. Now I must tell you of a country called Mulecte, where the Old Man of the Mountain used to dwell.
