				1	You must know there are two Armenias, a great and a lesser one, which last has a king who rules with pure justice, and is subject to the Tartars.
				2	This region contains many cities and castles, and abundance of all things, with beasts and birds for hunting and hawking ; but I must tell you the.
				3	air is not very healthy.
				4	The gentry used formerly to be valiant and good at arms ; but now they are mean and yile, and remarkable only for being hard drinkers.
				5	On the seacoast is a city named Laias,which carries on a very great trade ; for thither all the spices, rich cloths, and other precious articles, are brought from India across the Euphrates, which the merchants of Venice, of Pisa, and of Genoa, come to purchase.
				6	By this town we enter the province of Turcomania.
				1	Know, then, that in Persia there are eight kingdoms, because it is a very great country, and I will tell you their names.
				2	The first is called Casum ;the second, to the south, Cardistan ; the third Lor ; the fourth Cielstan ;the fifth Istanit ;he sixth Cerazi ;the seventh Soucara ;the eighth Tonocain,which is on the remotest frontier.
				3	In this last are many fine horses of high value, which are taken in large numbers to be sold in India; and the greater part of them are worth two hundred livres tournoiseach.
				4	They have also the finest asses in the world, one of which is worth full thirty mares of silver.
				5	The men of that country lead these horses to two cities on the banks of the sea of India, called Chisi and Curmosa, and find there merchants, who buy them and carry them into their distant country.
				6	In these kingdoms there are many cruel men, who are constantly killing one another, and but for the fear of the Eastern Tartars, who now rule in this land, they would ruin the merchants.
				7	As it is, unless the latter are well provided with arms and bows, they often kill or hurt them severely.
				8	These men all hold the law of Mohammed.
				9	In the city are industrious merchants ; they make robes of silk and gold of various fashions, and raise also plenty of cotton.
				10	The country abounds in wheat, barley, millet, as well asin vines and other fruits.
				11	Some may imagine that the Saracens do not drink wine, as being forbidden by their law ; but they quiet their consciences by thinking that if boiled over the fire, which renders it milder and sweet, it may be drunk without breaking the commandment.
				12	Changing its taste, they change its name, and no longer call it wine, though it really is so.
				13	Let us now leave them, and tell you of Yasdi.
				1	Yasdi § is a beautiful and noble city, with rich manufactures, The people make silk cloths called by its name, which the merchants carry into various countries.
				2	They all adore Mohammed.
				3	Whena man departs from that city, he rides seven days over a plain, where in three places only there are habitations and inns for the traveller.
				4	There are many forests filled with partridges and other birds, which afford excellent sport ; also beautiful wild asses.
				5	At the end of these seven days a country called Creman presents itself.
				1	Creman is a kingdom anciently belonging to Persia, and which used to be governed by a hereditary prince ; but since the Tartar conquered it, he appoints what deputy he pleases.
				2	In that region the stones called turquoises are in great abundance ; they are found in the mountains, and excavated from the rocks, The inhabitants make all things necessary for troops, such as reins, saddles, bows, arrows, quivers, and all kinds of arms, according to the custom of the country.
				3	The ladies work very neatly cloths of gold and silk, representing with the needle, beasts, birds, and many other objects.
				4	In the mountains are reared the finest falcons in the world, for though smaller than the peregrine species, they fly so swiftly that no bird can escape them.
				5	When a man leaves the city of Creman, he travels seven days through towns and fortified places, finding much amusement, because there are great numbers of wild beasts and birds, At the end of these seven days, he comes to the declivity of a mountain, and continues two days always descending.
				6	There are abundance of fruits, but no habitation, only shepherds pasturing their flocks.
				7	The cold on this road during winter is so great that a man cannot safely travel unless with a very ample provision of clothes.
				1	At the bottom of this descent is a very extensive plain, at the commencement of which is a city named Camandu,once wonderfully great and noble, but now much declined, because the Tartar invaders have repeatedly plundered it.
				2	The heat here is extreme, and the province is called Reobarle.
				3	Its fruits are dates, pistachio nuts, apples of paradise, and others which do not grow in our country.
				4	Here are a species of birds called francolin, which are different from those of other lands, their colour being a mixture of white and black, while the beak and feet are red.
				5	The oxen are very large, white as snow, and the hair very smooth, in consequence of the heat.
				6	Between the shouldersis a hump, two palms high, and their appearance is the most beautiful of any in the world.
				7	When the owner wishes to load them, they bend down as the camels do, and after receiving their burden, rise and bear it well, being extremely strong.
				8	There are sheep as large as asses, and with tails so thick and so broad as to weigh full thirty pounds.
				9	They are also fat, and make excellent food.
				10	The people have castles and cities surrounded by walls of earth, in order to defend themselves against the Caraunas, a mixed race between the Indians and the Tartars.
				11	When these people wish to overrun the country and rob it, they, by their enchantment and diabolical agency, cause the day to become dark, so that you can see to little or no distance, and this darkness they make to last seven days.
				12	They know the places so well, that they can ride during the thickest of it ; and they are sometimes ten thousand in number, so that nothing found on the plain, man, beast, or any thing, can escape.
				13	They kill the old persons, and carry off the young to sell them for slaves.
				14	Their king is called Nogodar, and he went to the court of Ciagatai, who was the brother of the great khan, with 10,000 men, and remained with him, because his uncle was very powerful.
				15	During this stay, Nogodar committed a very great wickedness, and I will tell you what it was.
				16	He departed from his uncle Ciagatai, who was in Great Armenia, and took with him 10,000 of his people, who were very cruel, and marched by Badasian and through a province called Pasciai, and another called Chesciemur, losing many of his people and beasts, because the roads were narrow and very bad; and when they had passed all these provinces, they entered into India, on the borders of one called Dilivar.
				17	They came to the city of the same name, and took it from a king called Asidiu Sultan, who was very great and rich.
				18	There Nogodar, with his people, continues to rule, and makes war with all the other Tartars who dwell in the surrounding country.
				19	Having told you of this plain, and of the people who produced darkness in order to rob, I must also mention that Messer Marco himself was nearly taken by them amid this gloom, but though a number of his companions were captured, and either killed or sold as slaves, he himself escaped to a castle named Canosalmi.
				1	That plain extends five days’ journey southward, and you then come to a descent which continues twenty miles by a very bad and difficult road, full of wicked robbers.
				2	You then approach the very beautiful plain of Formosa, watered by fine rivers, with plantations of the date-palm, and having the air filled with francolins, parrots, and other birds unknown to our climate.
				3	You ride two days through it, and then arrive at the ocean, on which there is a city and fort named Cormos.
				4	The ships of India bring thither all kinds of spiceries, precious stones, and pearls, cloths of silk and gold, elephants’ teeth, and many other articles.
				5	It is the capital of a kingdom, having many cities and castles under it, and the sovereign is called Ruemedan Achomac, The climate, however, is intensely hot, and extremely unhealthy, and when any foreign merchant dies, the king inherits all his property.
				6	Wine is here made of dates and other spices, and is extremely good ; but when drunk by men unaccustomed to it, has a strong purgative quality, though, after some use, it agrees well, and promotescorpulence.
				7	The people live chiefly on dates and salted fish, particularly the tunny ; considering these victuals to be the most wholesome, and that if they used wheaten bread and fiesh they would fall sick.
				8	The ships are very bad, and many are lost from not being secured by nails like ours, but sewed together by a thread made of the bark of the Indian nuttrees, which being softened in water, becomes like horsehair, and is durable enough.
				9	They use it for want of iron, but it is by no means strong or secure.
				10	They have a mast, sail, and rudder, all single, and a coverlet of leather, which is spread over the goods, and on that they place the horses, many of which are transported into India.
				11	These ships, too, are not tarred, but covered with the oil of fish, The people are black, and adore Mohammed.
				12	They do not remain in the city during summer, for then they would all die, but retire to the country, where they have verdant gardens, finely watered by streams.
				13	Even there they would not escape, because there often blows from the sandy tracts that surround the city a wind so excessively hot that it would kill them all, if they did not plunge into the water and thus escape it.
				14	They sow wheat, barley, and other kinds of grain in the month of November, and reap them in March, when they become ripe and perfect ; but none except the date will endure till May, being dried up by the extreme heat.
				15	I have also to tell you, when men or women die, great grief is shown, and the ladies, during full four years after the death of their husbands, make lamentations at least once a-day.
				16	On these occasions, they assemble their relations and neighbours, who join them in loud moanings and cries.
				17	In proof of the extreme violence of the heat, Marco Polo mentions the following circumstance which occurred during his residence.
				18	The ruler of Cormos neglected to pay his tribute to the King of Creman, who took the resolution of enforcing it at the season when the principal inhabitants gointothecountry.
				19	He therefore despatched 1600 horse and 5000 foot through the district of Reobarle, to take them by surprise.
				20	Being misled, however, by the guides, they did not reach the place till night, when they halted to rest in a grove near the town.
				21	On renewing their march next morning, they were attacked by the hot wind, and all suffocated ; not one surviving to carry back the fatal intelligence.
				22	When the people of Cormos learned this event, and went to bury the dead bodies lest they should infect the air, they found them so softened by the intense heat, that the limbs, when handled, separated from the trunks ; and it was necessary to dig graves close to where the corpses lay.
				1	We will now leave this city, and not go on to India, for I will describe it farther on in my book, in the proper time and place.
				2	We will return, therefore, by another road to Creman, because the countries now to be delineated can be reached only by way of that city, and I must tell you that Ruemedan Achomac, of whom we have just spoken, is subject to its king.
				3	The route in returning thither from Cormos is through avery fine plain.
				4	There are many springs whence the water issues in a hot state, forming baths very salutary in cutaneous and other diseases.
				5	Here is abundance of fruits and dates, also of partridges and other birds ; but the wheaten bread, owing to the quality of the water, is so bitter that no one unaccustomed to its use can eat it.
				6	I now wish to tell you of a country lying to the north.
				7	‘When a man has left Creman, he travels seven days in that direction, through a very dreary region.
				8	During three days he finds no river, and the little water met with is salt, green like grass, and so bitter that it is impossible to drink it, and if a man tastes even a drop, it produces violent purging.
				9	Travellers, therefore, carry water with them ; but-the beasts being obliged to drink such as they find, suffer severely.
				10	The whole tract is an arid desert, destitute of animals, which could not find food.
				11	On the fourth day, you reach a river of fresh water, but with its channel mostly under ground.
				12	In some spots, however, the force of the current makes abrupt openings, when the stream appears for a short space, and drink is abundantly supplied.
				13	Then follows another tract that lasts four days, and is also a dry desert, with bitter water, and no animals except wild asses, At the end of the four days, we leave the kingdom of Creman and proceed towards Cobinam.
				1	Cobinam is a great city inhabited by Mohammedans.
				2	There is abundance of iron, brass, and andanico, of the second of which they construct large and beautiful mirrors; they make here also the tutty, which is extremely good for the eyes, and likewise sponge, in the following manner.
				3	They take a vein of earth fitted for this purpose, and throw it into a burning furnace, above which is a grating of iron; then the smoke and moisture ascending adhere to the iron and form tutty, while the earth which remains in the furnace becomes sponge.
				1	‘When a man departs from Cobinam, he goes through a desert of eight days, and the country is very arid; there is neither fruit nor trees, and the water is bitter and bad, so that he must carry both it and food for himself, but the beasts drink that on.
				2	the road, though very unwillingly.
				3	He then comes to a province called Tonocain, with cities and many castles, bordering upon Persia towards the north; and there is a very great plain on which grows what the Christians call the dry tree, which I will describe to you.
				4	It is very large, and its leaves are green on one side and white on the other.
				5	It yields a nut like the chestnut ; but there is nothing within it.
				6	It is a strong wood, and yellow like box ; and there is no other tree in those parts for a hundred miles round, except on one side, at ten miles’ distance.
				7	It is said by the people of the country to be the place where Alexander fought with Darius.
				8	There are many towns and castles, and the inhabitants have abundance of all good things, the climate being neither too cold nor too hot.
				9	Now I must tell you of a country called Mulecte, where the Old Man of the Mountain used to dwell.
				1	You shall Jearn all about the Old Man of the Mountain, as I Marco heard related by many persons.
				2	He was called in their language Alaodin, and had caused to be formed, in a valley between two mountains, the largest and most beautiful garden that ever was seen.
				3	There grew all the finest fruits in the world, and it was adorned by the most beautiful houses and palaces, the interior being richly gilded, and furnished with finely coloured pictures of birds and beasts, and the most striking objects.
				4	It contained several conduits through which flowed respectively water, wine, honey, and milk.
				5	Here were ladies and damsels unequalled in beauty and in the skill with which they sung and played on instruments of every description.
				6	Now the Old Man made his people believe that this garden was paradise, and he formed it thus because Mohammed had given the Saracens to believe that those who went into that place would meet great numbers of beautiful women, and find rivers of water, wine, milk, and honey; hence the visiters were led to think that this really was paradise.
				7	Into this garden he admitted no man except those whom he wished to make assassins.
				8	The entry to the spot was commanded by a castle so strong that he did not fear any power in the world.
				9	He kept in his court all the youths of the country between twelve and twenty years of age, and when he thought proper, selected a number who had been well instructed in the description of paradise.
				10	He gave them a beverage which threw them into a deep sleep, then carried them into the garden, and made them be awakened.
				11	When any one of them opened his eyes, saw this delightful spot, and heard the delicious music and songs, he really believed himself in the state of blessedness.
				12	When again, however, he fell asleep, he was brought out into the castle, where he awoke in great wonder, and felt deep regret at having left that delightful abode.
				13	He then went humbly to the Old Man, worshipping him as a prophet.
				14	Being asked whence he came, he told that he had been in the paradise described by Mohammed, relating all he had seen, and saying that he desired much to die and return thither.
				15	The chief then named to him a great lord whom he wished him to kill.
				16	The youth cheerfully obeyed, and if in the act he was taken and put to death, he suffered with exultation, believing that he was to go into the happy place.
				17	If, after performing the deed, he escaped, the Old Man received him with the greatest honour, and when he wished to destroy another chief, employed him afresh, saying that he was sent into paradise.
				18	Thus scarcely any person could escape being slain, when the Old Man of the Mountain desired it; and many barons became vassals to him through the dread of thus losing their lives.
				1	Having now told you of the Old Man of the Mountain and his assassins, you shall hear how he was killed.
				2	I had forgot to mention, that he had other old men placed under him, one of whom he sent into the country of Damascus, and the other into Kurdistan.
				3	But now let us come to his destruction.
				4	It was in 1262 that Alau, the Lord of the East, having heard of his wicked deeds, determined to destroy him.
				5	He sent his generals with a great body of men, who besieged the castle full three years, and then could only reduce it by famine.
				6	Alaodin being taken, was killed, with all his people, and since that time there has been no assassin ; and thus ended his dominion and his wickedness.
				1	In Turcomania are three distinct races of men :—The Turcomans adore Mohammed, and are simple people, speaking a very rude language.
				2	They live amid mountains and valleys where there is good pasturage for cattle, by which they subsist ; and I assure you that they rear excellent horses and mules of great value.
				3	.
				4	The two others are Armenians and Greeks, who dwell iningled in cities, and subsist by merchandise and manufactures ; they work carpets and crimson silk, the richest and most beautiful in the whole world.
				5	They have many towns, of which the principal are Como, Casserie, and Sevasto.
				6	They are subject to the Eastern Tartars.
				7	Now, let us leave them, and speak of Armenia the Greater.
				1	When a man departs from that castle, he rides through beautiful hills covered with rich herbage, with fruits and all things in great abundance.
				2	The country extends to a journey of six days, and contains cities the inhabitants of which adore Mohammed.
				3	Yet sometimes yau find a desert of fifty or sixty miles, without water, which men must carry with them.
				4	When the traveller has rode six days through the country now described, he finds a city called Sapurgan.
				5	It has great abundance of all things, among which are the finest melons in the world in great plenty, and they are preserved in this manner: The people cut them all round like cucumbers, and dry them in the sun, when they become sweeter than honey, and are sold through all the country.
				6	Here is fine hunting of beasts and birds.
				7	Now I will go on to another city named Balk.
				1	Balk is a great and noble town, and was anciently still more so; but the Tartars have spoiled and wasted it, so that many beautiful houses and palaces of marble are now destroyed.
				2	It was here, as I was told by the people, that Alexander took to wife the daughter of Darius.
				3	The people revere Mohammed ; and at this point ends the dominion of the Eastern Tartars, this city being the boundary of Persia, between north-east and east.
				4	Now let us tell of another country named Dogans.
				5	On leaving Balk, you ride two days between north-east and east, and find no habitation, because the people have all fled to the fortresses in the mountains for fear of wicked men, who lay waste the land.
				6	There is no want of water or game, and lionsare also seen.
				7	No food is to be procured, but travellers must carry it both for themselves and their horses.
				1	When a man has rode these two days, he finds a castle called Taikan,where there is a great corn-market, and the country round is fine.
				2	The mountains towards the south are very high, and formed entirely of salt, which is the best in the world, and people come for it from a distance of thirty days’ journey round.
				3	It is so hard, that it can be broken only by great iron hammers ; and there is enough to supply the whole human race till the end of time.
				4	Departing from that city, you go three days north-east, through a fine country, well planted with grain and fruits.
				5	The people, who are followers of Mohammed, are wicked and murderous.
				6	They spend much time in the tavern, for they have abundance of good wine, well prepared.
				7	They wear nothing on their heads but a cord ten palms long wrapt round it.
				8	They are good hunters, and thus supply themselves with venison ; but have no clothing except the skins of animals.
				1	When a man travels three days, he finds a city named Scassem, which is on the plain, while the others are on the mountains, and through it flows a considerable river.
				2	There are here many porcupines, and when the hunters set their dogs upon them, the hogs collect together and push their spines against their assailants, and often hurt them severely.
				3	* This Scassem is a large province, and the shepherds dwell in caverns on the mountains, which are easily formed, being wholly of earth, and make large handsome habitations.
				4	t When aman leaves this city, he travels three days without finding a house, or any thing to eat or drink, being obliged to carry provisions with him, and he then enters the district of Badascian.
				1	Badascian is a large province, whose people adore Mohammed, and have a language of their own.
				2	It is governed by kings descended from Alexander and the daughter of Darius lord of Persia, and all these kings are called in Saracen Zulcarnem, which means in their language Alexander.
				3	In this country occur the precious stones called balasiu, which are very beautiful and valuable.
				4	They are found in the rocks of a mountain called Lighinan, and are cut out of very deep caverns, as is done by those who work silver mines, Know, too, that the king makes them be worked out for himself, and no other man may cut out balasiu on that mountain, on pain of death.
				5	His majesty sends them as presents to other princes and great lords, either as homage, or in token of friendship, and he likewise sells them for gold and silver.
				6	The prohibition is enforced that they may continue valuable ; for if all persons were allowed to dig for them, they would be quite depreciated.
				7	You must likewise know, that in other mountains of the same country are found the stones of which ultramarine is made, and it is the finest and best in the world.
				8	There are also lofty hills containing veins yielding silver in abundance.
				9	The country is extremely cold, but it breeds very good horses, which run with great speed over these wild tracts without being shod with iron.
				10	t There are found also the falcons called sacri, which fly well and swiftly ; also those called /anier ; and there is abundant hunting of beasts and birds.
				11	Wheat and good barley are plentiful ; they have no oil of olives, but make it from sesamum and nuts.
				12	This kingdom has many a narrow pass and strong post to secure it against the entrance of enemies, and the cities and castles are strongly built on high mountains.
				13	The people are good archers and hunters, and mostly clad in the skins of beasts, on account of the scarcity of cloth.
				14	The great ladies, however, wear from sixty toa hundred yards of bombasine wrapped round their body, in order that they may appear very fat, because the men delight in such a shape.
				15	On the summits of the mountains the air is so pure and salubrious that the inhabitants of the towns and lower valleys, when attacked by fever or other inflammatory complaints, immediately remove thither, and in three or four days recover their health.
				16	Marco Polo affirms, that he himself experienced its excellent effects ; for after being confined nearly a year by sickness, he was advised to try change of air by ascending the hills, and he then immediately regained his strength.
				1	You are to know that ten days south from Badascian is a province called Pascia.
				2	The people have a peculiar language ; they are worshippers of idols, and much skilled in enchantments and diabolical arts.
				3	The men wear ear-rings and buckles of gold and silver, with pearls and precious stones.
				4	They are a very artful and malicious people.
				5	The province is extremely hot, and the people live upon flesh and rice.
				6	Now let us leave it, and tell of another, which is distant from this seven days towards the south-east.
				1	Kesimur is inhabited by idolaters, who have a language of theirown.
				2	They have a wonderful knowledge of the enchantments of devils, making their images speak, and by sorcery changing the seasons, causing great darkness, and doing other wonders which could not be believed unless they were seen.
				3	The idols of this province are the heads over all the others, and went down hence to the neighbouring countries.
				4	The people are meagre and of a brown complexion ; but the females are very beautiful.
				5	They live on flesh and rice, and have a number of cities and castles.
				6	They have woods and deserts, and passes so strong that they have little dread.
				7	of an invader: their king rules with great justice.
				8	In this country are hermits, who observe great abstinence in eating and drinking, and carefully abstain from all offences against their faith ; and thisis done through veneration of their gods.
				9	They have abbeys and monasteries, are held in much reverence by the people of the country, and live toa great age.
				10	The coral brought from our land is sold more readily there than in any other nation.
				11	From this place you may go to the sea of India, and if we went farther we should enter into that country ; but being to return that way, we will then describe it in due order, and now go back to Badascian.
				1	When a man departs from Badascian, he goes twelve days between north-east and east, along a river which belongs to a brother of the lord of that land.
				2	There are many castles, and a good number of inhabitants, who are valiant and adore Mohammed.
				3	He then comes to a province named Vokhan, not very large, being only three days’ journey in every direction.
				4	The people are of the same description, and subject to the ruler of Badascian.
				5	Wild beasts and birds of every kind for hunting are most abundant.
				6	Having left this place, and travelled three days, always over mountains, he ascends to a district which is said to be the highest in the world.
				7	Here he finds a plain between two vast hills, through which flows a very fine river, issuing from a large lake ; and it is the best pasturage in the world, for a lean animal becomes fat here in ten days.
				8	All kinds of wild animals abound ; in particular, a species of sheep with horns of three, four, and even six palms long.
				9	These are formed by the shepherds into large spoons, out of which they eat ; and are even employed in enclosing the places where they keep their cattle.
				10	The hornsare heaped up in large quantities along the road, for the purpose of guiding travellers during winter, when it is covered with snow.
				11	t While a man passes for twelve days along this high plain, which is called Pamier,§ he sees neither habitation nor verdure, but must carry all his provisions along with him.
				12	No birds can live in this cold region; and I can even state that the fire does not burn so clear nor with the same colour as in other places, nor does it cook victuals so well.
				13	Leaving this place, he has to go on forty days between north and north-east, and passes many rivers and deserts ; and in all this journey finds neither verdure nor habitation, but must carry all his provisions along with him.
				14	This country is called Belor.
				15	t The people live in very lofty mountains, They are idolaters, extremely savage, violent, and cruel, subsist by hunting, and dress themselves in the skins of beasts.
				1	Cascar was anciently a kingdom, but is now under the dominion of the great khan.
				2	The people adore Mohammed, and have cities and castles; they are situated between the north and east.
				3	They subsist by merchandise and manufactures, having also fine gardens, vineyards, and orchards, with a good supply of silk.
				4	The merchants, in carrying on their trade, go round the whole world ; but they are sordid and covetous, eating and drinking very poorly.
				5	Some Nestorian Christians reside here, observing their own customs and laws.
				6	The people have a language of their own ; and the province extends five days’ journey.
				7	Now let us leave it and speak of Samarcan.
				1	Samarcan is a very great and noble city, lying to the south, inhabited by Christians and Saracens.
				2	The people are governed by a nephew of the great khan, who, however, is not his friend, but is in open hostility against him.
				3	I have to tell you a great wonder which happened in this city.
				4	You must know that not very long since, Ciagatai, brother to the great khan, became a Christian, and was lord of that and of many other countries.
				5	The believers of Samarcan rejoiced greatly at his conversion, and erected a large church in honour of it, bearing the name of St John the Baptist.
				6	They took a large and fine stone belonging to the Saracens, and made it the base of a column, which rose in the middle of the edifice, and supported the whole roof.
				7	Now it came to pass that Ciagatai died, whereupon the Mohammedans, having been much enraged at this stone being taken for the use of the church, consulted with each other how to recover it by force.
				8	This they could now easily do, being ten to one of their adversaries, Several of their elders went and told the Christians that they wished to receive back the slab, which had been formerly theirs.
				9	The latter answered, that they would willingly restore it, but for the injury it would do to their building, and offered to pay a fair price for it.
				10	The others replied, that they wished neither gold nor treasure, but must have their stone.
				11	The government now belonged to the nephew of the great khan, who commanded that within two days it should be restored.
				12	When the Christians received that order, they were much grieved, and knew not what to do.
				13	They went, however, and with many tears implored John the Baptist to relieve them in this tribulation.
				14	On the morning of the day when the stone was to be returned, the pillar, by the power of our Lord, rose up at least three palms, and supported itself as well as when the stone was beneath it, and has continued to do so till this day.
				15	This was and still is accounted one of the greatest miracles that ever happened in the world.
				16	Now let me tell you of a province which is called Yarcan.
				1	Armenia the Greater§ is a large country, and, at the entrance of it isa city called Arzinga, in which is made the best buckram in the world.
				2	There are several baths of warm spring water, the best and most beautiful any where to be found.
				3	There are many castles, and cities, among which the noblest is Arzinga, the seat of an archbishop, and the metropolis of the whole district; there are also Argiron and Darzizi.
				4	I assure you the province is very large, and during the summer all the Tartars of the Levant reside here with their flocks and herds, on account of its rich pastures ; but in winter they cannot remain because of the severe cold and snow, amid which the animals could not live.
				5	Now, in this Armenia is the ark of Noah on a great mountain.
				6	The circuit of its base cannot be traversed in less than two days ; and the ascent is rendered impracticable by the snow on its summit, which never dissolves, but is increased by each successive fall.
				7	On the lower declivities, the melted snows cause an abundant vegetation, and afford rich pastures for the cattle which in summer resort thither from all the surrounding -countries.
				8	To the south-east it borders on a kingdom called Mosul, inhabited by Jacobite and Nestorian Christians, of whom we will mention more hereafter.
				9	On the north’ it extends to the Georgians, and on that frontier is a fountain whence rises oil in such abundance that a hundred ships might be at once loaded with it.
				10	It is not good for eating, but very fit for fuel, for anointing the camels in maladies of the skin, and for other purposes ; for which reason people come from a great distance for it, and nothing else is burned in all this country.
				11	Now let us quit Armenia, and tell of Georgia.
				1	Yarcan is a province five days’ journey in length.
				2	The people obey the law of Mohammed, but there are some Nestorian Christians; they are subject to the nephew of the khan mentioned above.
				3	All necessaries are in great abundance.
				4	Cotton is also grown, and the inhabitants are skilful artisans.
				5	They suffer severely by swellings in the legs and in the throat, occasioned by the bad quality of the water.
				6	Finding nothing else worth mentioning, I shall go on to Cotan.
				1	Cotan is a province between north-east and east, and is eight days’ journey in length.
				2	The people adore Mohammed ; they have a number of cities and castles.
				3	The capital is a noble town, called by the name of the kingdom.
				4	They have all things in abundance, a large supply of silk, with vineyards and good orchards.
				5	They carry on merchandise and manufactures, but are not men at arms.
				1	Pein is a province five days’ journey in length, between north-east and east.
				2	The people adore Mohammed, are subject to the great khan, and have a number of towns and castles.
				3	The noblest city and capital is called by the name of the kingdom.
				4	Here is a river in which are found the stones named jasper and calcedony,.
				5	The people are very well supplied with necessaries, and grow a good deal of silk.
				6	They live by merchandise and arts, and have a custom which I will now tell you.
				7	‘When a woman has a husband who has gone a journey, and is to be absent above twenty days, as soon as he has departed she takes another partner, being fully allowed  by usage to do so; while the husband, in the place where he goes, takes another wife.
				8	Know that all the provinces now described from Cascar to the present, and still farther on, belong to Great Turkey.
				9	Now let us tell of a province named Ciarcian.
				1	Ciarcian is a province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east, with a capital city of the same name.
				2	The people adore Mohammed, and have a good number of towns and castles, There is a river bringing jasper and calcedony, which, being of excellent quality, they take to sell in Cathay, and thus make great profit.
				3	This province is sandy, as well as the whole road from Cotan hither ; and much of the water is bad and bitter, but in various places it is good.
				4	When an enemy passes through the country, they flee with their wives, children, and cattle, two or three days’ journey through the sand to places abounding in fine water and pasturage ; and no one can tell where they have gone, because the wind blowing the sand obliterates all traces of their march, and they thus escape the invader.
				5	But when a friendly army passes through, they send away only the beasts, because the troops would take and eat them, without any payment.
				6	After departing from Ciarcian, you go five days through the waste, finding the water bad and bitter, but occasionally sweet and good.
				7	At the end of these five days you come to a city which lies at the commencement of the great desert, wherein provisions are laid in for its passage, and therefore I must tell you about it.
				1	Lop is a large city at the entrance of the great desert bearing its name, and lying between the east and northeast.
				2	It belongs to the khan, and the people adore Mohammed.
				3	You must know that those persons who wish to pass this tract rest in the city a week to refresh themselves and their cattle ; then, having taken a month’s provisions and provender, they enter upon the desert, which I assure you is so extensive that if a man were to travel through its whole length, it would employ a year ; and even at its smallest breadth, a month is requisite.
				4	t It consists altogether of mountains and valleys of sand, and nothing is got to eat; but after travelling a day and a night, you find sweet water sufficient for from fifty to a hundred men, with their animals.
				5	A larger body could not be supplied.
				6	Thus, water is seen daily, or altogether in about twenty-eight places, and except in three or four it is good.
				7	Beasts or birds there are none, because they could not find food; but there is agreat wonder which I must now tell you.
				8	When a party rides by night through this desert, and any one lags behind, or straggles from his companions through sleep or any other cause, when he seeks to return to them, he hears spirits speak to him in such a manner that they seem to be his comrades, and they frequently call him by name, and thus lead him out of his way so that he never regains it, and many persons are thus lost and perish.
				9	I must tell you, too, that even by day you hear these voices of spirits, and even tambours, and many other instruments sounding.
				10	They find it necessary, also, before going to rest at night, to fix an advanced signal, pointing out the course to be afterwards held ; likewise to attach a bell to each of the animals, that they may be more easily kept from straggling.
				11	In this manner, amid much danger and fear, this desert is passed.
				12	Now we must tell you of the countries that lie on the other side.
				1	When you have rode thirty days through this desert, you find a city named Sacchion,which belongs to the khan, The province is called Tangut,and the people are idolaters, mixed with some Nestorian Christians and Saracens.
				2	The first have languages of their own ; they subsist not by merchandise, but by the grain which they produce from the earth.
				3	They have many abbeys and monasteries, all full of idols of various shapes, to which they offer frequent sacrifices and homage.
				4	Every man who has children rears a sheep, and at a particular festival at the end of the year, leads them along with that animal into the presence of the god, to whom they all perform reverence.
				5	They cook the sheep and offer it very humbly before the idol, leaving it while they make their prayers for the safety of their children.
				6	They then take the meat and carry it to the house, or wherever they please, send for their relations, and eat it with great joy and respect.
				7	They afterwards collect the bones, and preserve them with much diligence.
				8	You must know likewise, that when any one of them dies, his body is burned, and after he is carried to the place for this last ceremony, they erect in the middle of the path a house of cane, covered with cloths of silk and gold.
				9	When the dead man is laid before this ornamented house, they place before him wine and victuals, believing that he will be similarly honoured in the other world.
				10	At the place of burning, too, they cut in paper, men, horses, camels, and coins of the size of bezarits, convinced that the deceased will possess all these things in the future state.
				11	On this occasion, all the instruments in the land are sounded before the corpse.
				12	I must tell you, too, that after death the relations send for the astrologer, who is informed of the day, month, and year of his nativity, and then divines, by his diabolical art, the day on which the burning ought to take place.
				13	If it should be a week, a month, or six months, they keep it all that time, and never burn it till the appointed day.
				14	During this interval, they deposit it in a large box covered with cloth, and so preserved with crocus and other spices that no stench arises.
				15	Throughout this period, they place daily before the box meat and drink, and leave it there for some time, till they think he has eaten it.
				16	These sorcerers, too, often tell the relations that the dead body must not be carried out by the main door, but by a private one, or even through a breach made in the wall.
				17	All the idolaters in the world proceed in this manner.
				18	Now I must go to another city which lies to the south, near the extremity of this desert.
				1	Kamult is a province, formerly a kingdom, containing cities and castles, with a capital of the same name.
				2	It stands between two deserts, the great one already described, and a smaller one, extending three days’ journey.
				3	| The people are all idolaters, and have a peculiar language ; they live by the fruits of the earth, having enough to eat, and also to sell to the passenger.
				4	They are men of great gaiety, thinking of nothing but to sound musical instruments, to sing, dance, and delight their hearts, When a stranger comes to lodge in a house, the master is highly pleased, and leaves him with his wife, desiring her to treat him in every respect as a husband, while he himself goes and spends two or three days elsewhere.
				5	All the men of the province proceed in this manner, and do not account it any disgrace.
				6	The women are handsome, gay, and fond of diversion.
				7	Now, when Mangou Khan reigned as sire of the Tartars, it was reported to him how the people of Kamul gave over their wives to strangers, when he sent orders that, under a severe penalty, travellers should not be henceforth entertained in this manner.
				8	When they received this injunction, they were greatly grieved, held a council, and did what I will now tell you.
				9	They made up a large present, and sent it to Mangou, praying that he would allow them to treat their wives according to the custom handed down to them by their ancestors, who, for this kindness to strangers, had gained the favour of their idols, and their corn and other crops had greatly multiplied.
				10	When he heard this message, he said, “Since you are so bent on your own shame, let it be so”.
				11	He allowed them, therefore, to do as they pleased, and hence they have always maintained this custom.
				1	Ginghintalas is a province which is near the desert, between north and south, sixteen days’ journey in extent, and subject to the great khan.
				2	It contains cities, castles, and three descriptions of men, idolaters, adorers .
				3	of Mohammed, and Nestorian Christians.
				4	On the borders of it, towards the north, is a mountain containing a very abundant vein of copper and antimony.
				5	There is also one from which is made the salamander; but do not suppose this is the animal so called, for no creature can live in fire, because it is compounded of the four elements.
				6	It is only through ignorance that the salamander is called an animal ; and a Turk, named Zurficar, who was very learned, and governor of this province for three years under the great khan, being much employed in working the mines, gave me an account of it.
				7	When this ore is taken from the mountain, and is broken, it strings together, and forms a thread like wool.
				8	Being then dried, pounded in a large mortar, and washed, there remains that thread of which I have spoken.
				9	Being then woven like wool, it forms cloth, which is dingy in colour at first, but when placed and left some time in the fire, it becomes white as snow, without dirt or stain.
				10	This is the truth of the salamander, and every thing else said about itis mere fable.
				11	I can tell you, too, that at Rome there is a cloth which the great khan sent to the pope as a costly present, and the sudarium of our Lord was placed within it.
				12	Now let us tell you of other provinces to the south-east and east.
				1	When you have departed from the province now described, you go ten days in the same direction.
				2	In all that way there are few habitations, nor does any thing occur worth mentioning.
				3	You then finda district called Succiur,with a capital of the same name.
				4	The people are Christians, and idolaters, and under the great khan.
				5	All the three provinces last described belong to the general one named Tangut.
				6	Through all its mountains, rhubarb is found in great abundance, and the merchants purchase and carry it over the whole world.
				7	t They cannot, however, take this road through the mountains with any animals but those accustomed to the country, because a poisonous plant grows there, which, when eaten, causes the hoofs to drop off ; but the native cattle, having learned its dangerous quality, carefully avoid it.
				8	t They live by the fruits of the earth, but attend little to merchandise.
				9	Now I must tell you of another city.
				1	Canpicion is a great and noble town, chief and capital of the whole province of Tangut.
				2	The people are idolaters, and there are some who adore Mohammed, and also Christians who have three large and beautiful churches.
				3	The first have monasteries and abbeys according to their custom, with a very great number of idols, some of which, I assure you, are ten paces high, severally formed of wood, of earth, and of stone, all beautifully covered with gold and ivory.
				4	Their priests live more respectably than others, and guard themselves against luxury, though they do not hold it for a very great sin.
				5	They observe the lunar months like ours, and in one of them do not kill any beast or bird.
				6	For five days they eat no food that has had life, and live more strictly than usual.
				7	They take sometimes thirty wives, or as many as they have wealth to maintain, and give them a dowry in beasts, slaves, and money ; but the first wife ranks always as the principal.
				8	If any of them do not please him, she may be divorced.
				9	They marry their cousins and even the wives of their father, and do not regard as sins many things which we account great ones ; for they live like beasts : therefore let us leave them and go to the north.
				10	But I must tell you that Messeri Nicolo, Maffio, and Marco, remained in that city a year, on particular business which I need not enter into.
				11	We shall now go sixty days northwards.
				1	In Georgia§ is a king always called David Melik, which means David the King ; he is subject to the Tartars ; and anciently all the monarchs of this province were born with the mark of an eagle on their left shoulder.
				2	They are a handsome people, good archers, and valiant in battle.
				3	They are Christians of the Greek church, and wear their hair close shaven in the manner of clergy.
				4	This is the province which Alexander could not pass through on account of the narrowness of the path ; because on one side is the sea, and on the other very high mountains, over which it is impossible to ride ; and, as this strait continues above four leagues, a few men might hold out against the whole world.
				5	This was the reason why he could not pass; but he built a very strong tower, that no one might come upon him from the other side, and it is called the Iron Gate.
				6	This is the place mentioned in the book of Alexander, where he enclosed the Tartars within their mountains ; though the Tartars did not exist at that time, but a certain people called Comani, and other races besides.
				7	.
				8	There are many cities and castles, with silk in abundance, with which, added to gold, they make cloths the most beautiful that ever man saw.
				9	Here are the finest cagles in the world ; also victuals of every kind in abundance.
				10	The province is full of great mountains, and of narrow passes, so that I can tell you the Tartars could never obtain the entire sovereignty of it.
				11	There isa monastery called St Leonard, containing a great wonder, which I will now relate.
				12	A large lake of water issues from a neighbouring mountain, in which, during the whole year, there is not found a fish great or small, except from the day before Lent down to the evening of Easter Sunday ; and during the whole of that time fishes are taken in great abundance, but none at any other.
				13	And know that this sea of which I have spoken is seven hundred miles in circuit, and receives the Euphrates, one of the delights of paradise, and many other great rivers.
				14	It is all surrounded by mountain and land; and lately the merchants of Genoa, who have built shipa, navigate it, bringing silk, which is called gelle.
				15	* Into this sea the great rivers Herdil,t Geihon, Kur, and Aras enter.
				16	In that province there is a grand city named Teflis, with suburbs and fortified posts around it.
				17	The inhabitants are Armenian and Georgian Christians, with some few Mohammedans and Jews.
				18	There are manufactures of silk and other articles.
				19	Now, having told you of the boundaries of Armenia to the north, I will describe those to the south and east.
				1	After riding twelve days, you come to a city named Ezina,which is at the northern extremity of the desert of sand, and still in Tangut.
				2	The people, who are idolaters, breed camels and other beasts, and have falcons of different species and of good quality.
				3	They live by the fruits of the earth and cattle, and are also employed in merchandise.
				4	In this city, a man lays in provisions for forty days, during which time, travelling from Ezina northwards, there is neither habitation nor inns.
				5	But the people, except during summer, remain in the valleys; and in the mountains they find a number of wild beasts, especially asses: there are also pine-forests.
				6	At the end of these forty days they reach a northern province, and you shall hear what it is.
				1	Karakorum isa city three miles in circuit,which was the first that the Tartars took when they issued from their country, and I am to tell you of their actions and manners, how they gained command, and spread themselves over the world.
				2	You must know that they dwelt in the north, about Ciorcia, in which region are great plains, and no abode in cities or castles, but good pasturage, large rivers, and abundance of water.
				3	They had no lords, yet paid tribute to the great sire, named in their language Unchan, whom we call Prester John, and who is spoken of over all the world.
				4	They paid to him one beast out of every ten; but they multiplied so greatly, that he became afraid of them, and resolved to separate them into different countries; for which purpose he sent his barons among them.
				5	The Tartars on hearing this were much grieved, and, holding a council, determined to flee through desert countries to the north, where he could not reach nor injure them.
				6	They then ceased to obey or pay tribute to him,and remained thus for a long time.
				1	Now it happened that, about 1187, the Tartars appointedaking, who was named in their language Gengis Khan.
				2	He was a man of great worth, sense, and prowess; and let me tell you, when he was elected, all the Tartars in the world that were scattered through those strange countries came and owned him as their lord.
				3	He maintained his power with great vigour, and the multitudes who ranged under his standard were almost innumerable.
				4	When he saw so numerous an army, he went conquering other countries, and made himself master of eight provinces ; yet he neither injured nor robbed the people of any thing, but placing them under leaders in whom he could confide, led them on to other triumphs.
				5	Thus he overthrew, as you have.
				6	heard, a multitude of nations ; and seeing his good command and mildness, they cheerfully followed him, upon which he formed the design of subduing a great part of the world.
				7	In the year 1200, he sent a message to Prester John, asking his daughter to wife.
				8	"Hereupon that monarch was very indignant, and said,—""What impudence is this in Gengis Khan!"
				9	Knows he not that he is my man and my vassal?
				10	Return, and tell him that I would burn my daughter sooner than give her to him, and that he deserves to be put to death as a traitor and disloyal to hislord”.
				11	He then desired the messengers to depart forthwith, and never return.
				12	They presently went away, and coming to their master, told him in order all that the other had said.
				1	When Gengis Khan heard this boastful speech, his heart swelled, so that it almost burst within him ; for you must know he was a man of very great pride.
				2	He then said to his minister, and to all about him, that he would not continue to hold the sovereignty, unless Prester John were made to pay more dearly for this villany than ever man did, and he must soon be made to see whether he was his vassal.
				3	Then he summoned round him the greatest army that ever was seen or heard of, and sent notice to Unchan that he must defend himself, as he was coming against him.
				4	When that prince knew certainly the approach of Gengis with so great a force, he made light of it, saying, they were not men-at-arms ; yet.
				5	resolved that should he approach, he would do all in his power to take and put him todeath.
				6	He then ordered all his people to be prepared and summoned from many and strange parts,and a greater host and of more formidable aspect was never seen.
				7	And why make a long story!
				8	The khan, with all his people, came to a great and beautiful plain, named Tenduc, in Prester John’s country, where he pitched his camp, and rejoiced greatly to hear that his enemy was coming, because it was an excellent situation for giving battle.
				9	He sent for his astrologers, who were Christian and Saracen, and required to know which would conquer in that battle, he or his antagonist.
				10	The latter could tell nothing of the truth ; but the former showed it openly; for they brought before him a cane, cut in the middle, and placed the two parts on different sides, and wrote the name of Gengis on one, and of Unchan on the other, telling him, that when they had made their enchantment, he whose cane should come above that of the other would conquer in battle.
				11	He desired that this should be shown to him as soon as possible.
				12	Then they took up the Psaltery, read certain portions, and performed their enchantment, when presently the cane on which was the name of Gengis, without any one touching it, joined the other, and mounted above it, and this was witnessed by all present.
				13	When he saw this, he was greatly rejoiced, and seeing that the Christians were men of truth, held them always in great honour.
				14	Two days after, the armies engaged, and it was the greatest battle that ever was fought.
				15	The slaughter was terrible on both sides; but at length Gengis conquered, his enemy was slain in the engagement, and he himself became master of all his land.
				16	From that day he went on conquering many castles and provinces, and reigned six years ; but, at the end of that time, he besieged a fort, named Cangui, where he was wounded in the knee by an arrow, and died.
				17	This was a great misfortune, for he was a brave and wise man.
				1	After the death of Gengis, the next khan was Cui, the third Bacui, the fourth Alton, the fifth Mangou, the sixth Kublai,who is greater and more powerful than all the rest; for the other five together had not so much power as this Kublai ; nay, let me tell you, that all the emperors in the world, and all the Christian and Saracen kings, do not equal him, as is shown fully in our book.
				2	Now you must know that the great lords of the lineage of Gengis Khan are buried in a lofty mountain called Altai, and whenever the chief lords of the Tartars die, if it should be a hundred days’ journey distant, they must be conveyed thither to be interred.
				3	I will tell you another striking wonder ; that when the bodies of the khans are carried to these mountains, the conductors put to the sword all the men whom they meet on the road, saying, “ Go and serve the great lord in the other world ;” and they do the same to the horses, killing also for that purpose the best he has, You must know that when Mangou died, more than 20,000 men were slain, who had been met on the road when his body was removed to be buried.
				1	Now since I have begun speaking of the Tartars, I will tell you many thingsabout them.
				2	They abide during winter in plains and warm situations, where there is abundant herbage for their cattle; and in summer they retire to cool places on mountains and high valleys, where water abounds.
				3	They have wooden houses covered with felt, of a round shape, which they convey with them wherever they go; for they have them so well bound with twigs as to be easily carried.
				4	Whenever they take down and set up a house, the gate is always placed to the south.
				5	They have waggons so well covered with black felt, that if it should rain the whole day, no water would reach any thing within ; and they are drawn by oxen and camels.
				6	On the top they place their wives and children ; and I must tell you that the ladies buy, sell, and perform all the work necessary for their husbands, who do nothing but hunt, hawk, and go to war.
				7	They live on flesh, milk, and the produce of hunting, and likewise on rats of Pharaoh, which are found here in great numbers.
				8	They eat also the flesh of camels, dogs, and indeed of every kind of animal, and drink mare’s milk.
				9	They shun the seduction of married females, as a most vile and shameful thing; and the wives are very faithful, performing extremely well the business of the household.
				10	Every man may take as many as he pleases, even to a hundred, if he can maintain them ; yet they hold the first as the principal and most respectable.
				11	They scruple not to marry their cousins, and if the father dies, the eldest son may take all his wives, except his own mother ; he marries also the widow of his deceased brother.
				12	They celebrate their marriages by great festivals.
				13	The Tartars, who believe in a deity of a sublime and heavenly nature, burn incense in censers to him, and pray that he may preserve them in health of mind and body.
				14	They have also one called Nacygai, whom they call their earthly god, who guards their children, cattle, and corn, They fashion him of felt and cloth, keep him in their house, and pay him great honour and reverence.
				15	They make for him also a wife and children of cloth, placing the first on his left hand, and the latter in front.
				16	Before eating, they take the fat meat and anoint his mouth with it; then lay bread before the door of his chamber.
				17	Having done this, they say that their god and his family have had their share, and sit down to their own meals, I told you that they drink mare’s milk, but it is in such a manner that it seems white wine, being of an agreeable taste, and called chemius.
				18	The wealthy wear rich robes of gold and silk, with varied furs of the ermine, sable, and fox.
				19	Their harness is beautiful and of great value; their arms are bows, swords, and clubs ; but the first is more used than the others, because they are excellent archers.
				20	On their back they wear armour of buffalo and other very strong hides.
				21	I will tell you the manner in which they maintain justice.
				22	If a man has stolen an article of little value, they give him seven lashes, or seventeen, or twentyseven, going on thus always to three hundred and seven, and many die under them.
				23	If he steals a horse or any thing else for which he deserves to die, he is cut through the middle with a sword; yet if he can pay nine times the value of what he has stolen, he is allowed to live.
				24	Every lord or other man, who owns oxen or any cattle, makes them be marked with his seal, and then allows them to feed on the plains or among the mountains ; and whoever finds one straying brings it to him whose mark is upon it.
				25	The sheep and lambs, however, are guarded by ashepherd.
				26	Their cattle are all remarkably large, fat, and beautiful.
				27	They have another wonderful custom which I had forgot; for when two men have one a son, the other a daughter, dead at the age of four, they marry them together, and represent the union by cards, which they set on fire, and when they see the flame and smoke ascending, they make great shouts and run backward and forward, saying that the dead are going to their children in the other world, and are to be husband and wife there.
				28	They do more, for they paint on cards the similitudes of men, horses, cloths, bezants, and harness, then burn them, and say that all these things will be possessed by their children in the other world.
				1	The Tartars are good men-at-arms in battle, capable of much endurance; and they can go through more warlike toil than other men.
				2	Often, when necessary, one of them will remain a month without any food, except the milk of a mare and the flesh of animals killed by him in hunting, his horse feeding on the grass, without his needing to bring barley or straw.
				3	He is very obedient to his master, and when necessary will remain the whole night armed on horseback.
				4	They are the men in the world most capable of enduring fatigue and trouble, subsisting at the least expense, and best fitted for conquering lands and kingdoms.
				5	They arrange their armies in the following manner.
				6	When a Tartar lord goes to war, he has with him 100,000 men.
				7	He places a chief over every ten, every hundred, every thousand, every ten thousand, so that each officer, even the commander of the hundred thousand, has to deal only with ten persons; for he gives his orders to the chiefs of ten thousand, they to those of one thousand, they to those of a hundred ; and thus every man answers to his captain.
				8	The hundred thousand is called a tut, and ten thousand a toman.
				9	When the armies are marching through plains and mountains, they send 200 men two days in advance, also behind and on each side, so that they cannot he attacked by surprise.
				10	And when they are marching a long way they carry no baggage, but merely two large leathern bags, in which they put their milk, and a little earthen pot for cooking their victuals.
				11	They take a small tent, under which they remain during rain.
				12	And I tell you also, that when necessary they ride full ten days without food, and without lighting a fire; but piercing a vein of their horse, they drink his blood.
				13	They have likewise their milk dried into a species of paste, which, when about to use, they stir till it becomes liquid and can be drunk.
				14	When they go to battle with their enemies, they conquer in this manner: they apparently betake themselves to a shameful flight, for they have so trained their horses that they turn round and round like dogs.
				15	And when they are fleeing and hotly pursued, they fight as well as when they face the enemy ; for in their swiftest flight they wheel about and discharge their arrows, which kill both men and horses of the opposite army, who, when they think their adversaries discomfited and vanquished, fall themselves one after the other.
				16	When the Tartars have thus made a great slaughter, they turn and rush on so violently, that they soon gain a complete triumph.
				17	All that I have told you here applies to the genuine Tartars ; but they are now much altered ; those who live in Cathay have adopted the manners and customs of the idolaters ; those in the Levant imitate the Saracens.
				18	I have said nothing here of the mighty acts of the great khan, the sire of all the Tartars, nor of his splendid imperial court ; for these wonderful things are described elsewhere in this book.
				19	But let us now return to our route on the great plain where we were when we began to speak of their actions.
				1	When you depart from Karakorum, and from Altai, where the khans are interred, as I have related above, you go northwards through a country which is called the plain of Bangnu, and continues during a journey of forty days.
				2	The inhabitants, who are called Mecri, and are very savage, live on the flesh of animals, chiefly deer, nay I assure you that they ride upon these animals.
				3	Their customs resemble those of the Tartars, and they are subject to the great khan.
				4	They have neither corn nor wine, but in summer abundance of beasts and birds for hunting and hawking ; though in winter none remain in the country on account of the intense cold.
				5	After travelling these forty days you come to the ocean ; and there is found a mountain, where the peregrine falcons build their nests.
				6	You must know this place contains neither men nor women, nor beasts, nor any birds, except one species, which is called barghenlac, on which .
				7	the hawks feed.
				8	They are of the size of partridges, have feet like parrots, and tails like swallows, and they fly very swiftly.
				9	When the great khan wishes peregrine falcons, he sends thither for them, In an island of that sea, too, are bred the gerfalcons; and I assure you the place is so far north, that the polestar remains behind, and is seen to the south.
				10	Those birds are bred on that isle in such abundance, that the great khan obtains as many as he pleases; while others are conveyed to Argon and other lords of the East.
				11	Now that I have told you of these northern provinces as far asthe ocean, let us return to Canpicion.
				1	‘When a man departs from that city, he goes five days eastward through a country where there are many spirits, who are often heard speaking during the night.
				2	You then find a kingdom called Erginul,* belonging to the great khan, and included in the large province of Tangut.
				3	There are a good many towns, the chief one bearing the same name ; and the people are a mixture of Nestorian Christians, idolaters, and Mohammedans.
				4	Proceeding thence south-east, you come into the country of Cathay, when you will find in the way a city named Singuy.
				5	There are a good many other towns, still in Tangut, and subject to the great khan; and the inhabitants are as above described.
				6	There are a vast number of wild oxen, as large as elephants, and very beautiful, —their back being entirely covered with white and black hair, three palms long.
				7	These animals are also caught and tamed, when they do twice as much work as the common ox.
				8	This country, too, produces the best musk in the world, and I will describe the animal by which it is supplied.
				9	It is small, about the size of an antelope, which it resembles in the feet and tail, but has a soft thick hair like the stag, no horns, only four teeth, two above and two below, three inches long and very sharp.
				10	It is a beautiful creature; and, on its being taken, there is found a bag between the skin and the flesh, containing a bloody imposthume, which, when the skin is cut through, is drawn out, and forms the musk whence issues so strong an odour.
				11	In this country it is very abundant, and of good quality.
				12	The people also raise plenty of corn,and engage in merchandise and manufactures.
				13	The region extends to a journey of full twentyfive days.
				14	There are pheasants twice as large as ours, with tails from seven to ten palms long.
				15	Others resemble ours; and there are various birds, with finely coloured wings.
				16	The people, who are idolaters, are fat, with small noses, black hair, and no beard unless on the chin.
				17	The ladies have no hair except on the head, and are every way very handsome.
				18	The men are voluptuous, and are authorized by their law and usage to take as many wives as they can maintain.
				19	If a woman is beautiful, though of humble birth, a great baron readily espouses her, giving to her mother such a sum of money as may be agreed on.
				1	When a man departs from Erginul, and goes eight days castward, he finds a province of Tangut called Egrigaia, where there are cities and castles, and the chief one is named Calacian.
				2	The people are idolaters ; yet there are three towns held by Nestorian Christians.
				3	They are subject to the great Tartar; and in this city is made cloth of camels’ hair, the most beautiful and valuable in the world.
				4	There is akind of wool whence they manufacture very fine white camlets in great quantities.
				5	These the merchants convey by many routes to Cathay and other parts throughout the world.
				6	Now let us go to Tenduc, in the territory of Prester John.
				1	Mosul is a great kingdom on the eastern border of Armenia, and inhabited by various denominations of men, whom I will now describe.
				2	There is a race called Arabic, who adore Mohammed ; also another who hold the christian law, but not as the church of Rome commands ; they err in many things.
				3	They are denominated Nestorian and Jacobite, and have a patriarch named Jatolior, who makes archbishops, bishops, abbots, and other clergy, and sends them to all parts of Bagdad, India, and Cathay, as the pope does from Rome.
				4	All the Christians who are in those parts are of this sect ; and all the cloths of silk and gold, which are called mosulin, are made there.
				5	I tell you, too, that the great merchants who are called mosulin, and bring the largest quantity of all costly spices, are of this kingdom.
				6	Among its mountains are people called Kurds, who are Nestorian and Jacobite Christians, but some are Saracens, and reverence Mohammed.
				7	They are an overbearing and wicked people, ever ready to rob the merchants.
				8	Now let us leave Mosul, and speak of the great city of Baldach.
				1	Tenduc is a province towards the east,where there are cities and castles, and the chief one bears the same name.
				2	The people belong to the great khan, like all those formerly subject to Prester John.
				3	In this province there is a king named George, descended from that prince, and who indeed enjoys his power.
				4	He holds the land under the khan, but only a part of that which was possessed by his ancestor.
				5	I assure you, however, that the khans have often given their daughters and female relations to the reigning kings of this line.
				6	In this province are found the stones whence azure is made ; they are plentiful and good.
				7	Camlets, too, are woven of camels’ hair.
				8	The natives live on cattle and the fruits of the earth, and have likewise some merchandise and manufactures, The Christians, as already mentioned, are masters of the land ;but there are also idolaters and worshippers of Mohammed.
				9	There is likewise a people called Argon, meaning in French Guasmul, that is, mixed of two different races.
				10	They are handsomer than the others, more prudent and commercial.
				11	Know that in this province was the chief.
				12	seat of Prester John, when he ruled over the Tartars and all the surrounding countries ; and this George is the sixth in succession from him.
				13	This, too, is the place which we in our country call Gog and Magog, but they call it Ung and Mungul ;and in each province was a different race of people,—in Ung were the Gog, and in Mungul dwelt the Tartars.
				14	When a man rides through that province seven days eastward towards Cathay, he finds many cities and castles, The inhabitants are Mohammedans, idolaters, and Christians ; they carry on trade, and manufacture fine gilded cloths, called nascisi, with various kinds of silk cloth, and are subject to the great khan.
				15	There is a city named Sindacui, with many manufactures of harness and trappings necessary for an army.
				16	In the mountains of that country is a place named Idifu, where there is a very productive silver mine.
				17	They have no want éf beasts and birds for hunting.
				18	Now let us depart from this province and its cities, and travel three days, when we shall find a town named Cianganor, in which is a fine palace of the great khan [already described, p. 136].
				1	Departing from this city, and travelling three days between north and north-east, you come to another named Chandu,t built by Kublai, the great khan now reigning.
				2	Here he has built a most magnificent palace.
				1	At this place dwelt the caliph, chief prelate of all the Saracens in the world, as the pope is at Rome.
				2	Through the middle of it flows a very large river, by which you can proceed to the sea of India, whence merchants go and come with their goods.
				3	From Baldach tothe ocean by the stream is a voyage of eighteen days.
				4	The merchants going to India sail down that river to a place named Chisi,} and then enter the Indian sea.
				5	Between Baldach and Chisi is a great city named Bascra ;§ and the woods around that city yield the finest dates in the world.
				6	In Baldach are many rich cloths of silk and gold, on which birds and beasts are represented ; and it is the greatest and noblest city in all these regions.
				7	And know, assuredly, that the caliph was found to possess the most abundant treasure in gold, silver, and precious stones that ever was in the possession of man ; and I will tell you how it happened.
				8	In the year of our Lord, 1255,the great sire of the Tartars, who is named Alau,brother to the great sire that now reigns, assembled a very large army, and marched upon Baldach and took it by force, which was a glorious exploit ; for it contained more than 100,000 horsemen besides foot soldiers ;and when it was taken, he found the caliph in possession of a tower full of gold, silver, and other treasure, such as never was seen at once in one place.
				9	When he discovered it he sent for the monarch and said : “Caliph, why have you amassed such a treasure, and what do you mean todo with it?
				10	Did you not know that I was your enemy, and coming to attack you with this mighty host!
				11	Knowing this, why did you not take your treasure, and give it to knights and soldiers to defend you and your city?
				12	” The caliph replied nothing, because he knew not what to say.
				13	Then, said Alau: “Caliph, since I see you love so much your treasure, I will give it you to eat”.
				14	He then commanded that he should be shut up in the tower with the treasure, and that nothing should be given to him to eat or drink.
				15	Then he said to him: “ Caliph, eat your treasure as heartily as you please, for you will never eat any thing else”.
				16	He was then immured in the tower, where he died at the end of four days.
				17	And after him there never was any other caliph.
				1	Toris is a great city, in a province called Yrac, containing many towns and castles ; but as this is the chief, I will tell you about it.
				2	The men live by merchandise, and by fabricating fine cloths of silk and gold.
				3	The place is so well situated that merchants proceed hither from India, Baldach, Mosul, Cremosor, and many other places.
				4	The Latin traffickers come to meet those from strange countries, from whom they purchase precious pearls and other valuable articles.
				5	The men are of indifferent character and very mixed origin, Armenians, Nestorians, Jacobites, Georgians, and Persians, and some who adore Mohammed.
				6	The inhabitants of the city are called Taurisians.
				7	Around it are very fine gardens, full of fruits and vegetables.
				8	The Saracens here are most wicked and disloyal.
				9	They maintain that whatever is robbed or plundered from men of a different creed is justly acquired ; while they regard as martyrs those of their own sect who die by the hands of Christians.
				10	If, therefore, they were not checked by their present rulers, they would break out into many outrages.
				11	These principles are common to them all.
				12	At the point of death, the priest comes and demands whether they believe that Mohammed was the prophet of God.
				13	If they profess this belief, they are assured of salvation ; and through this easy absolution, which leaves scope for the perpetration of every crime, they have succeeded in converting many of the Tartars, who feel thus at liberty to indulge their worst propensities,  Near Toris is a monastery named after St Barsamo, and famous for sanctity.
				14	It contains an abbot and many monks, who dress like the Carmelites.
				15	Unwilling to lead an idle life, they are constantly weaving woollen girdles, which they place on the altar of their saint during divine service ; and while going round the province to ask alms (as do their brethren of the Holy Ghost), they present these to their friends and persons of distinction, who value them as beneficial in the cure of theumatism.
				1	Now I am to tell you of a great miracle which happened between Baldach and Mosul in the year 1225.
				2	There was a caliph in the former who held the Christians in great hatred, as it is natural for all the Saracens in the world to do, He thought day and night how he might compel all those in his country to become converts, or else kill them.
				3	Many others concurred in that wicked purpose, and they agreed upon this plan : They found in the gospel a text saying that if a Christian had as much faith as a grain of mustard-seed and made his prayer to God, he would be able to join two mountains together.
				4	On finding this text, they felt great joy, thinking they had thus either a means of converting them, or a pretext for killing them outright.
				5	He therefore sent for all the Jacobite and Nestorian believers in his country, who were very numerous; and when they came before him, he showed them this gospel, made them read it, and asked if it were true.
				6	They replied that it was so.
				7	Then, continued the caliph, since so many Christians are here, there surely must be among you this small measure of faith ; therefore, said he, pointing to a large hill in view, you must remove that mountain, or I will put you allto death, because otherwise you must be wholly destitute of faith, and on that account deserve to die.
				8	If, however, you will turn to our good law of Mohammed, you shall be forgiven; and, in the mean time, I allow you tefi days to do what is required.
				9	He then dismissed them.
				10	On hearing what the caliph had said, they were in great fear, and knew not what to resolve.
				11	Then they all assembled, small and great, men and women, the bishop, archbishop, and priests of whom there were a considerable number, and they remained eight days and eight nights in prayer, that God, in his mercy, and for the diffusion of his faith, would come to their aid, and enable them to escape this cruel death with which they were threatened.
				12	But what have I now to tell you!
				13	While they were thus deeply engaged in prayer, an angel, by the message of God, appeared to a bishop who was a man of very holy life.
				14	He said, “Oh, bishop!
				15	do you now go to acertain shoemaker with one eye, and tell him that at his prayer the mountain will be moved”.
				16	Now this shoemaker was a very honest and chaste man ; he fasted and went regularly to mass, and ‘gave every day bread to the poor.
				17	I will tell you a thing that he did, to prove his good faith and life.
				18	It happened one day that a very beautiful woman came to his shop to purchase a pair of shoes, and in order to make them fit, he was obliged to look at her foot and ankle, and they were so finely shaped that he felt his eye take an undue pleasure in viewing them.
				19	As soon as she was gone, he began bitterly to reproach himself, and remembered the text, “if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee”.
				20	He then took a sharp weapon, and stuck it into his eye, so that it burst in his head, and he never saw with it again.
				21	Thus you see he was a most holy and good man.
				22	When, therefore, the bishop had this vision, he told it to all his people, and they agreed that this shoemaker should be called before them, and when he came, they requested him to pray to God that he would make the mountain move.
				23	But when the shoemaker heard what the bishop and the others said, he answered that he was not so good a man as that God or our lady should for his sake do so great a miracle.
				24	But the Christians pressed him so earnestly, that he at last agreed, and made the prayer.
				25	When the final day was come, they all rose early in the morning, great and small, male and female; and entering the church, they sung the holy mass, and then proceeded out to the plain in front of the mountain.
				26	They were fully a hundred thousand, and they all placed themselves in front of the cross.
				27	The caliph then came with a vast number of Saracens, eager to slay the unbelievers, for they thought it impossible the hill could be moved, and they themselves were in great fear and doubt ; nevertheless they had good hope in their Creator.
				28	Then the shoemaker fell on his knees before the cross, lifted his hands to heaven, and prayed fervently that the mountain might be moved, and the Christians there assembled escape a dreadful death.
				29	When he had made his prayer, it was not long before the vast eminence began to stir, and move from its place.
				30	The Saracens, on seeing this, wondered greatly, and many of them were converted ; nay, the caliph himself became a believer in the gospel, but secretly, and when he died, a cross was found round his neck; for which reason he was not buried in the same place with the other sovereigns, but in a tomb by himself.
				31	Now let us leave Baldach and go to Persia.
				1	Persia isa very extensive province, anciently very rich and flourishing, but now in a great degree wasted and destroyed by the Tartars.
				2	It contains a city called Sava, whence the three magi came to adore Jesus Christ when born at Bethlehem.
				3	In that city are buried the three, in separate tombs, above which is a square house carefully preserved.
				4	Their hearts are still entire, with their hair and beards.
				5	One was named Balthazar, the other Gaspar, the third Melchior.
				6	Messer Marco inquired often in that city about these three magi, but no one could tell him any thing, except that they were ancient kings, who were there buried.
				7	They informed him, however, that three days’ journey farther was a tower called the Castle of the Fire-worshippers, because the men there venerate fire, and for the following reason.
				8	They say that anciently three kings of that country went to adore acertain prophet, newly born, and carried three offerings, gold, incense, and myrrh, to know if he were a king, a god, or a sage; for they said that, if he took gold, he was aking; if incense, he wasa god; if myrrh, he was a sage.
				9	They went in one after another, and though they were of different ages and fashions, he appeared to each of them exactly like himself.
				10	When they came out and compared what they had seen, they wondered much, and then went in altogether, and the child then appeared to them what he really was, a boy of thirteen days old.
				11	They presented to him the three offerings, and he took them all, whence they concluded that he was at once god, king, and sage.
				12	He presented to them a closed box, desiring them not to open it till their return home.
				13	After having travelled a number of days, however, they were curious to see what was in the box, and opened it, when they found only a stone, which was meant to express that they should remain firm in the faith which they had received.
				14	They did not understand this meaning, and despising the gift, threw it into a well, when immediately a great fire came down from heaven, and began to burn brightly.
				15	When they saw this wonder, they were quite astonished, and repented that they had thrown.
				16	away the stone.
				17	They however took a portion of the fire, carried it to their country, and placed it in their church, where they kept it continually burning.
				18	They revere it as a god, and use it for burning all their sacrifices ; and when at any time it goes out, they repair to that well, where the fire is never extinguished,and from it bring a fresh supply.
				19	This is what all the people of that country tell, and Messer Marco was assured of it by those of the castle, and therefore it is truth.
				20	One of these kings was of Saba, the other of Ava, the other of the castle.
				21	Now let me tell you of Persia, its cities, and the actions and customs of the people.
