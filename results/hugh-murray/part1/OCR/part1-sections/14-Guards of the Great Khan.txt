When the great khan holds a court, he is guarded, on account of his excellency and honour, by 12,000 horsemen, who are called quiesitan, that is, faithful servants of their lord; and this he does not from fear but regard to his high dignity. Over these 12,000 are four captains, so that each commands 3000; and they keep guard in turn three days and three nights, eating and drinking at the expense of the prince. Then they go away, and another party comes ; and so they proceed throughout the whole year.
