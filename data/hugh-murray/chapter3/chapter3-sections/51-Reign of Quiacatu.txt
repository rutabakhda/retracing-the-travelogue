When Argon was dead, his uncle, named Quiacatu, brother to Abaga, immediately seized the throne, which was easily effected, as Casan was distant at the Arbor Secco. The latter, when informed of these eyents, was much grieved at the death of his parent, and still more incensed at Quiacatu having seized his inheritance. He was afraid, however, to march at once against him, but resolved, that at the proper time and place he would take as signal vengeance as his father had done on Acomat.Thus Quiacatu obtained general obedience, except over the troops whom Casan immediately commanded. He married the wife of Argon his nephew, and indulged largely in the pleasures of the seraglio. At the end of two years, however, his death ensued, being occasioned by poison.
