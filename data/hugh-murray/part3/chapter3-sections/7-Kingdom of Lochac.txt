Leaving this island, and sailing between south and south-west 700 miles, you find two isles, a large and a small, called Sondur and Condur.Departing thence, and going south-east still 500 miles, you find a very extensive province named Lochac.The people are subject only to a native king, are idolaters, with languages of their own. They are tributary to no power, being so situated that no invader can reach their land ; otherwise it would soon be subdued by the great khan. Brazilwood is in abundance, and gold in almost incredible quantities. There are elephants and other animals for hunting; and from this place is derived all the porcelain that is circulated as money through the provinces now described. I have only to add, that the country is difficult to reach; the king himself does not wish to be visited by strangers, and thus no one knows his treasure and condition.
