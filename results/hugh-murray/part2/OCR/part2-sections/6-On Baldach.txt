At this place dwelt the caliph, chief prelate of all the Saracens in the world, as the pope is at Rome. Through the middle of it flows a very large river, by which you can proceed to the sea of India, whence merchants go and come with their goods. From Baldach tothe ocean by the stream is a voyage of eighteen days. The merchants going to India sail down that river to a place named Chisi,} and then enter the Indian sea. Between Baldach and Chisi is a great city named Bascra ;§ and the woods around that city yield the finest dates in the world. In Baldach are many rich cloths of silk and gold, on which birds and beasts are represented ; and it is the greatest and noblest city in all these regions. And know, assuredly, that the caliph was found to possess the most abundant treasure in gold, silver, and precious stones that ever was in the possession of man ; and I will tell you how it happened. In the year of our Lord, 1255,the great sire of the Tartars, who is named Alau,brother to the great sire that now reigns, assembled a very large army, and marched upon Baldach and took it by force, which was a glorious exploit ; for it contained more than 100,000 horsemen besides foot soldiers ;and when it was taken, he found the caliph in possession of a tower full of gold, silver, and other treasure, such as never was seen at once in one place. When he discovered it he sent for the monarch and said : “Caliph, why have you amassed such a treasure, and what do you mean todo with it? Did you not know that I was your enemy, and coming to attack you with this mighty host! Knowing this, why did you not take your treasure, and give it to knights and soldiers to defend you and your city?” The caliph replied nothing, because he knew not what to say. Then, said Alau: “Caliph, since I see you love so much your treasure, I will give it you to eat.” He then commanded that he should be shut up in the tower with the treasure, and that nothing should be given to him to eat or drink. Then he said to him: “ Caliph, eat your treasure as heartily as you please, for you will never eat any thing else.” He was then immured in the tower, where he died at the end of four days.And after him there never was any other caliph.
