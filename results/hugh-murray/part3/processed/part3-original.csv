3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	1	India and the Ships navigating thither.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	2	Having described so many inland provinces, I will now enter upon India, with the wonderful objects in that region.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	3	The ships in which the merchants navigate thither are made of fir, with only one deck, but many of them are divided beneath into sixty compartments, in each of which a person can be conveniently accommodated.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	4	They have one rudder and four masts ; while some have two additional, which can be put up and taken down at pleasure.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	5	Many of the largest have besides as many as thirteen divisions in the hold, formed of thick planks mortised into each other.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	6	The object is to guard against accidents which may cause the vessel to spring a leak, such as striking on a rock or being attacked by a whale, This last circumstance is not unusual ; for dur-  ing the night the motion of the ship through the waves  raises a foam that invites the hungry animal, which,  hoping to find food, rushes violently against the hull,  and often forces in part of the bottom.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	7	The water,  entering by the leak, runs on to the well, which is al-  ways kept clear ; and the crew, on perceiving the occur-  rence, remove the goods from the inundated division, and  the boards are so tight that it cannot pass to any other.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	8	They then repair the injury and replace the articles.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	9	The  plaiJ^ are double, fastened with iron nails, and plastered  without and within, but not secured by pitch, of which  the people are destitute.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	10	They therefore take lime, beat  it into fine powder, and mix it with an oil from trees, so  that it becomes equal to glue.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	11	These vessels carry two  hundred mariners, and five or six thousand loads of  pepper ; they are moved by oars, on each of which four  hands are employed.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	12	Every one of them has two barks,  large enough to carry a thousand loads, and forty seamen  well armed, who often assist in dragging the large ships.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	13	Ten small boats are also kept for fishing and various other services ; two being attached to each bark.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	14	‘When the ships have sailed a year, and stand in need of repair, a fresh plank is fastened above the two others, then nailed and cemented, till they sometimes acquire a depth of six planks.
3	part3	1	Voyage through the Indian Seas, and Historical Accounts I	15	Having thus described the merchant-vessels that go to India, I will tell you of the country itself ; but first I must mention the many isles in this sea lying to the eastward ; and first, of one named Zipangu.
3	part3	10	Kingdom of Ferlech	16	In that of Ferlech are Saracen merchants, who come with their vessels, and have converted the people to the law of Mohammed ; but only in the city, for those in the mountains live like brutes, eating the flesh of men and of the vilest animals.
3	part3	10	Kingdom of Ferlech	17	They worship various objects, particularly the first thing they meet after rising in the morning.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	18	Leaving Ferlech, you enter Basman,a kingdom by itself, whose people have a language of their own, and live without law, like beasts.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	19	They own the supremacy of the khan, but pay him no tribute, because the great distance prevents his troops from reaching them; yet they sometimes make him a present of strange objects.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	20	Here are wild elephants, and unicorns not much smaller, being double the size of a buffalo.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	21	They have a large black horn in the middle of the forehead, and beneath the tongue sharp prickles, which can inflict severe wounds, Their heads resemble that of the wild boar, yet they carry them bent to the earth.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	22	They are very ugly, and fond of wallowing among mire.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	23	It is not true, as asserted among us, that they allow themselves to be taken by a virgin, but quite the contrary.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	24	There are here good and serviceable falcons, black like crows ; also a prodigious number of monkeys of various forms and habits.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	25	But you must know that those who bring the little men from India practise a great deception.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	26	I assure you the figures to which they give that name are manufactured in this island in the following manner :— There is a species of small monkey, with a face resembling the human, which they catch, skin, and shave off all the hair except on the beard and chin; having then moulded them intoa human semblance, they dryand preservethem with camphor and other articles.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	27	But it is a gross deception ; for neither in India, nor in any other country, however savage, are there men so small as these pretended ones.
3	part3	11	Kingdom of Basman	28	t Now let us tell of a kingdom called Samara.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	29	When a man departs from Basman, he finds the kingdom of Samara, in which I myself, Marco Polo, remained five months, because the bad weather did not allow us to sail, Here neither the north star nor the constellation of the Greater Bear appeared.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	30	The people are savage idolaters, governed by a rich and powerful king, and owning a nominal submission to the great khan.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	31	During our stay, we landed and erected castles of wood and twigs, where we remained through the fear of these wicked men, who eat their fellow-creatures.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	32	The best fishes in the world are found here.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	33	The people have no wheat, living on rice ; and they make no wine.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	34	You must know there is a kind of tree, of which they cut a branch, and place a pot beneath, when, during the night, the vessel is filled, and very good wine is thus produced, both red and white.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	35	The tree resembles a small date-palm, with four branches, and when it ceases to give out more wine, they water its root, which causes it to produce again.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	36	* They have great quantities of very large Indian nuts, and eat all kinds of flesh, good and bad.
3	part3	12	Kingdom of Samara	37	Now let us tell you of a kingdom which is named Dagroian.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	38	This kingdom has a language of its own; the people are very savage, subject to a king, but owning the supremacy of the great khan.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	39	They are savage idolaters, and have the following very bad custom :—When a man falls sick, his relations send for the magicians, and inquire if he will recover, as these deceivers profess to know, by their enchantments and idols, whether he will live or die.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	40	Inthe latter case, the friends send for persons who place something over hismouth, by which he is suffocated.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	41	They then cook the body, and all the kinsmen come and eat his flesh, taking care not to leave the smallest portion; which they believe would breed worms, and thus seriously afflict the soul of the deceased.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	42	They next collect the bones, and place them in a large and beautiful chest, which they carry to caverns in the mountains, beyond the reach of wild beasts or any other injury.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	43	When they take any man belonging to another country, who cannot redeem himself, they kill and eat him in like manner.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	44	This is a very bad practice.
3	part3	13	Kingdom of Dagroian	45	I must now, however, tell you something of Lambri.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	46	Lambri is a kingdom having a sovereign of its own, who owns the supremacy of the khan.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	47	The people are all idolaters ; they have a great abundance of camphor and other spices ; likewise brazil-wood.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	48	This they sow, and when it has grown to a little twig, they transplant it to another place, and at the end of three years root it up.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	49	We brought some of this seed to Venice, but it did not spring at all on account of the cold.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	50	I will tell you another very wonderful thing ; for there are men in this kingdom who have tails like dogs, larger than a palm, and who are covered with hair.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	51	They remain in the mountains, never visiting the towns.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	52	* There are unicorns, with various beasts and birds for hunting.
3	part3	14	Kingdom of Lambri	53	Now let us depart and tell you of Fansur.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	54	The people of Fansur are idolaters, have a king, and nominally acknowledge the great khan.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	55	Here grows the best canfara fansuri, which is much more valued than any other ; indeed it sells for its weight in gold.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	56	Wine is drawn from trees, in the manner described above : another wonder is, that, in this province, meal is obtained from them.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	57	These are large, the bark thin, and the interior all full of meal.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	58	The inhabitants take it out, and make a very good paste, of which we often ate.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	59	Having told you of the kingdoms in this part of the isle, I will say nothing of the two others, because we did not.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	60	visit them.
3	part3	15	Kingdom of Fansur	61	I will now, therefore, go to another small island called Gavenispola.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	62	Departing from Java and the kingdom of Lambri, and travelling northward about 150 miles, you find two islands, one of which is called Necuveran.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	63	t The people have no king, and live like brutes, both men and women going quite naked.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	64	They are idolaters, and have forests of noble and valuable trees ; among which are sandal-wood, the Indian nut, clove, brazil, and many others.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	65	Angaman is a very large island, without a king; the people idolaters, resembling savage beasts; indeed they are a most extraordinary race, having a head, teeth, and jaws like those of a mastiff dog.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	66	They are very cruel, and eat all the men of every other nation whom they can seize.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	67	They have great abundance and variety of spices, with fruits different from ours, but live chiefly on flesh and milk.
3	part3	16	Islands of Necuveran and Angaman (Nicobar and Andaman)	68	Having told of these various people, I will now mention another island.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	69	When you depart from Angaman, and sail.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	70	about a thousand miles westward, a little to the south, you reach the island of Seilan,the very best of its size in the world.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	71	It is 2400 miles in circuit ; yet I must tell you that anciently it was larger, being 3600, as appears by the old maps of the mariners on that sea ; but the north wind blows with such violence, that a great part has been carried away by the water.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	72	[ The people have a king called Sendemain, and are tributary to none ; they are idolaters, and go quite naked, except a small covering round the middle.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	73	They have no grain but rice, living on it and on flesh.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	74	I will now describe the most precious thing in the world; for here are noble and beautiful rubies, which can be procured nowhere else ; also the sapphire, the topaz, the amethyst, and various other precious stones.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	75	The king has the most beautiful ruby that ever was or can be in the whole world.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	76	It is the most splendid object on earth, and seems to glow like fire; it is of such value as money could scarcely purchase.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	77	The great khan sent his messengers to him, wishing to buy it, and offering the value of a city.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	78	The monarch replied, that he had received it from his ancestors, and would for no earthly consideration part with it.
3	part3	17	Island of Seilan	79	The people are not menat-arms, but unwarlike and cowardly ; when they need soldiers in war, they send for those of another country, commonly for Saracens.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	80	I have also to tell you that in this island there is a great mountain, of which the rocks are so broken that it can be ascended only by chains of iron suspended, whereby men may mount to the summit.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	81	Here, according to the Saracens, is the monument of Adam our first father ; but the idolaters consider it as that of Sergamon Borcam.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	82	They describe this last as the first man whose image they worshipped, and as the best that ever lived in their country.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	83	He was son to a great, rich, and powerful king, yet refused to succeed to the throne, or to attend to any worldly concern.

3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	85	He made him large promises, offering even to resign, and raise him immediately te the throne ; but the youth would listen to no such proposal.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	86	The father was like to die of grief, but bethought himself of a plan for bringing him back to the world.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	87	He lodged him in a very fine palace, and appointed 30,000 beautiful damsels to serve and amuse him.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	88	The prince, however, remained insensible to their seductions, and led a more virtuous and chaste life than before.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	89	Now his habits had been g0 recluse that he had never seen a dead person, or one not perfectly sound in his members.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	90	One day, happening to ride across the path where a man lay dead, he was utterly astonished, and asked of his attendants what that was.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	91	This being explained, he inquired if all men died, and being told they did so, he walked on, musing very deeply.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	92	Some time after, he saw one unable to walk, and with all his teeth decayed through extreme old age.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	93	Having asked, and being informed what that was, he declared he would no longer remain in this evil region, but would seek a place where men neither died nor grew old.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	94	He left the palace, and journeyed into great and trackless mountains, where he spent his whole life virtuously and chastely, observing rigid abstinence ; so that had he been a Christian, he must have been a very great saint.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	95	When he died, his corpse was carried to his father, who, on seeing the body of one whom he loved better than himself, was grieved to the heart.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	96	He made an image of him composed of gold and precious stones.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	97	All the people of the country adored him as a god, and they say that he died eighty-four times, becoming first an ox, then a horse, then a dog, and various other animals ; but that the eighty-fourth time he became a god, and they worship him as their best and greatest.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	98	These were the first idolaters, from whom all the others in Seilan were descended.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	99	But I assure you, many from the most distant countries come hither on pilgrimage, as Christians to the shrine of St James, and the monument on this mountain is said to be that of the prince, whose teeth, hair, and skull were preserved.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	100	But the Saracens say that it is that of Adam, our first parent.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	101	God knows which is right, but one cannot believe the latter, for the Scriptures of our holy church assure us that he died in another part of the world.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	102	Now it happened that the great khan, hearing that the tomb of Adam, with the other objects mentioned, was on this mountain, sent, in 1284, a numerous embassy, who travelled by land to the island of Seilan.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	103	They went to the king, and procured two of the grinding teeth, which were very large, also the hair, and the cup, of beautiful green porphyry.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	104	They then returned, and sent notice to their sovereign of what they were bringing, when he ordered his subjects to go forth and meet these relics of our first father.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	105	All the citizens of Kambalu came out; the chief men received the sacred objects, and brought them to his majesty, who welcomed them with great joy and reverence.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	106	I assure you, too, they found this cup to be of such virtue, that when food was introduced for one man, there would be enough for five ; and the great khan declared he had tried this, and found it the truth.
3	part3	18	Origin of the Boodhist Religion in Seilan	107	Now having told you truly all this history, I will leave it and relate other things.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	108	When you depart from Seilan, and go westward about sixty miles,you come to the extensive provinceof Maabar, on the mainland.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	109	It is called India the Greater, and is indeed the noblest and richest country in the whole world.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	110	t In this province there are five kings, who are brothers, and the one that reigns here is called Senderbandi Davar.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	111	The largest and finest of pearls are found in a gulf between this continent and the island, having nowhere more than ten or twelve paces depth of water, and in some places only two.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	112	Vessels, large and small, resort thither from the beginning of April to the middle of May, and cast anchor in a place called Bettalar, about sixty miles out at sea; they then go in boats and begin the fishery.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	113	Many merchants, formed into companies, hire and pay the men employed.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	114	They gave a tenth to the king, and a twentieth to the Abraiamain, who enchants the fishes, depriving them of the power to injure the persons who dive under water for the pearls ; indeed he can enchant also all kinds of beasts and birds.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	115	The charm, howevet, lasts only during the day; at night the animals enjoy full liberty.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	116	When the men in the boats have found water four to twelve feet deep, they plunge to the bottom, and get shells called sea-oysters, and within whose flesh are found pearls of all sizes and shapes.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	117	These are brought up in very large quantities, and distributed over the world,—the king drawing from them a great revenue.
3	part3	19	Kingdoms of Maabar	118	During the rest of the year they are not found here; but at a place 300 miles distant, where they are taken from September to the middle of October.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	119	This is a very large island, fifteen hundred miles from the continent.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	120	The people are fair, handsome, and of agreeable manners.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	121	They are idolaters, and live quite separate, entirely independent of all other nations.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	122	Gold is very abundant, and no man being allowed to export it, while no merchant goes thence to the mainland, the people accumulate a vast amount.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	123	But I will give you a wonderful account of a very large palace, all covered with that metal, as our churches are with lead.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	124	The pavement of the chamber, the halls, windows, and every other part, have it laid on two inches thick,so that the riches of this palace are incalculable.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	125	Here are also red pearls, large, and of equal value with the white, with many other precious stones.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	126	* Kublai, on hearing of this amazing wealth, desired to conquer the island, and sent two of his barons with a very large fleet containing warriors, both horsemen and on foot.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	127	One was named Abatan, the other Vonsanicin, both wise and valiant.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	128	They sailed from Zai-tun and Kin-sai, reached the isle, landed, and took possession of the plain and of a number of houses ; but they had been unable to take any city or castle, when a sad misadventure occurred.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	129	A mutual jealousy arose amongst them, which prevented their acting in any concert.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	130	One day when the north wind blew very strong, the troops expressed to each other apprehensions, that if they remained, all the vessels would be wrecked.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	131	The whole then went on board and set sail.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	132	When they had proceeded about four miles, they found another small isle, on which, the storm being violent, a number sought refuge.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	133	Others could not reach it, many of whom suffered shipwreck and perished ; but some were preserved and sailed for their native country.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	134	Those who had landed, 30,000 in number, looked on themselves as dead men, seeing no means of ever escaping ; and their anger and grief were increased, when they beheld the other ships making their way homeward.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	135	The sovereign and people of the large isle rejoiced greatly when they saw the host thus scattered and many of them cast upon the islet.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	136	As soon as the sea calmed, they assembled a great number of ships, sailed thither and landed, hoping to capture all those refugees.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	137	But when the latter saw that their enemies had disembarked, leaving the vessels unguarded, they skilfully retreated to another quarter, and continued moving about till they reached the ships, and went on board without any opposition.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	138	They then sailed direct for the principal island, hoisting its own standards and ensigns.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	139	On seeing these, the people believed their own countrymen had returned, and allowed them to enter the city.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	140	The Tartars, finding it defended only by old men, soon drove them out, retaining the women as slaves.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	141	When the king and his warriors saw themselves thus deceived, and their city captured, they were like to die of grief; but they assembled other ships, and invested it so closely as to prevent all communication.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	142	The invaders maintained it seven months, and planned day and night how they might convey tidings to their master of their present condition ; but finding this impossible, they agreed with the besiegers to surrender, securing only their lives.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	143	This took place in the year 1269.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	144	The great khan, however, ordered one of the commanders of this host to lose his head, and the other to be sent to the isle where he had caused the loss of so many men, and there put todeath.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	145	I have to relate also a very wonderful thing, that these two barons took a number of persons ina castle of Zipangu, and because they had refusedto surrender, ordered all their heads to be cut off ; but there were eight on whom they could not execute this sentence, because these wore consecrated stones in the arm between the skin and the flesh, which so enchanted them, that they could not die by steel.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	146	They were therefore beaten to death with clubs, and the stones, being extracted, were held very precious.
3	part3	2	Island of Zipangu, and Tartar Expedition thither	147	But I must leave this matter and go on with the narrative.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	148	Now, in all this province of Maabar, there is not a tailor, for the people go naked at every season.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	149	The air is always so temperate, that they wear only a piece of cloth round the middle.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	150	‘The king is dressed just like the others, except that his cloth is finer,t and he wears a necklace full set with rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and other precious stones, worth a great treasure.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	151	He has also suspended from his neck a silken cord, reaching a pace down, and containing 104 of the largest pearls and most valuable rubies.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	152	It is worn because he repeats every day, morning and evening, 104 prayers in honour of his idols.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	153	To this he is bound by his faith and religion, by the example and injunction of his ancestors.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	154	He wears also round three parts both of his arms and legs, bracelets of gold, full of goodly stones and pearls.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	155	In short, the number of his jewels is surprising, being of more value than a handsome city, and no wonder, since they are all produced in his own dominions.
3	part3	20	Hindoo Customs and Superstitions	156	No man is allowed to export either a pearl or stone of great value, but must produce it to him, and as he gives double its cost, they do so very willingly, whence he has collected so ample a store.

3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	215	At this kingdom we arrive after departing from Maabar and travelling northward about a thousand miles.
3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	216	It is subject to a queen of great wisdom, whose husband died forty years ago, and her love to him was such that she has never married another.

3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	219	In this kingdom, you must know, is found the diamond ; there are several mountains, among which, during rain, water flows with great turbulence, and through wide caverns; and when the shower ceases, men search through the ground previously inundated, and find the gems, In summer, there is not a drop of water, and the heat can scarcely be endured, while fierce and venomous serpents inspire great fear; yet those who venture thither discover valuable diamonds.
3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	220	There is also an extensive and deep valley, so enclosed by rocks as to be quite inaccessible; but the people throw in pieces of flesh, to which the diamonds adhere.
3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	221	Now you must observe, there are a number of white eagles, which, when they see the flesh in the bottom of the valley, fly thither, seize and carry it to different spots.

3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	224	Now this is the only country in the world containing these precious stones ; and do not suppose that the best come to our christian countries ; they are carried to the great khan and other lords of those regions, whose ample treasure enables them to purchase.

3	part3	21	Masulipatam—Diamonds of Golconda	227	I must now describe the place containing the body of the apostle St Thomas.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	228	This is in a small town of Maabar, containing few inhabitants, and seldom visited by merchants, there being little trade, and the roads difficult.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	229	Many Christians and Saracens, however, resort thither in pilgrimage: the latter esteem him a great saint, and even assert that he wasa Mohammedan.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	230	But I will now relate awonder.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	231	The Christians, who repair to that shrine, take from the place a red earth, carry it into their country, and give a small portion to any person sick of a fever, who is presently cured.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	232	But I have now a miracle to tell ; for about the year 1288, a baron of this district had a great quantity of rice, and filled with it all the houses around the church.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	233	The pilgrims having thus no place to lodge, prayed him much to desist ; but being fierce and proud, he paid no regard to their entreaty.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	234	Next night, accordingly, Messer St Thomas appeared to him with a fork in his hand, which he thrust forcibly against his throat, causing severe pain, and saying, “ If you do not forthwith empty my houses, you shall die an evil death”.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	235	He disappeared, and the baron rose early in the morning, related the apparition, and caused all the buildings to be emptied.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	236	The Christians greatly rejoiced, and honoured this great apostle.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	237	I could relate other wonderful cures effected on persons labouring under various bodily infirmities; but I will now merely describe his death.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	238	He had left his hermitage in the wood, and was engaged in prayer, while around were a number of peacocks, which are more numerous here than elsewhere in the world.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	239	Now an idolatrous Gaui, aiming at one of these birds, let fly an arrow without seeing the saint, whom, however, it struck on the right side ; and finding himself thus wounded, he very mildly adored his Creator, and soon after expired.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	240	But before coming hither, he had converted many people in Nubia,as I will afterwards narrate.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	241	When a child in this province is born, they anoint him every day with the oil of sesamé, which makes him become blacker than at birth; for whoever ix most deeply tinted is honoured in proportion.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	242	Indeed, these people paint their god and all their idols black, and their devils white as snow.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	243	The men, when they go to battle, place such faith in the ox as a holy thing, that they take the hair of the wild bull, and if they fight on a horse, attach it to the neck ; if on foot, to their shield ; thinking themselves thus better secured against every danger.
3	part3	22	St Thomas (Madras), Legends respecting him	244	Hence, the hair of this animal sells at a considerable price.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	245	Lar is a province lying westward of this place, and thence came originally all the Abraiamain in the world.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	246	These are the best and most honest of all merchants, and would not on any account tell a lie.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	247	They neither eat flesh nor drink wine, are faithful to their wives, and lead every way very virtuous lives.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	248	They take nothing from any one, and do nothing that could be considered a sin.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	249	They are all known by a silk thread worn over the shoulder, and tied beneath the opposite arm, so that it passes across both the breast and back.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	250	t They have arich king, who readily purchases precious stones, and enjoins that the merchants shall offer to him all the pearls brought from Maabar, for which he pays double the cost.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	251	They therefore procure them in large quantities.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	252	Theyare idolaters,and regard omens from birds and beasts more than any other nation in the world.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	253	I will tell you one of their customs: when one wishes to treat for any merchandise, he rises and observes his shadow in the sun ; and if it be of the due length, on that day, according to certain rules, he makes his bargain ; but if it be not long enough, he will not buy a single article.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	254	If they go to a house for this purpose, and see one of the animals named tarantula, which here greatly abound, they observe if it comes to them from a lucky quarter, in which case they buy ; but if otherwise, they give up the transaction and go away.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	255	Nay, I assure you, if one leaving his house hears a man sneeze in a manner that does not appear lucky, he stops and re-enters, Even if on his road he sees a swallow approaching from the right or left, in an unlucky manner, he returns.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	256	Their teeth are very good, through the use of an herb, which makes them look extremely well, and is very salutary.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	257	They never bleed from the vein or any other part, yet perfectly preserve their health.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	258	There are among them an order named cuigui, who live to an extraordinary age, even 150 or 200 years, yet can perform all the service of the monastery and idols as well as younger men.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	259	This is owing to their great abstinence in eating and drinking ; for they subsist mostly on rice and milk.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	260	They mingle also quicksilver and sulphur, making a beverage which they drink from their infancy, saying that it lengthens their lives.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	261	t There is also in this kingdom a religious order of more rigid cuigui, observing the strictest abstinence, leading a very rude and severe life, and going perfectly naked.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	262	They adore the ox, and many wear on their forehead a small effigy of one in copper or bronze gilded.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	263	They also burn the dung, and reduce it to a powder, with which they reverentially anoint many parts of their body, as Christians use holy water.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	264	They eat neither from spoon nor platter, but from large leaves, mostly of the apple of paradise.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	265	Even these must be dry ; for if green, they are said to have a soul, which it would be sin to kill; and they would rather die than commit towards any animal an action believed unlawful.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	266	When asked why they feel no shame in going naked, they say, because they wish to have nothing belonging to this world, which they entered without clothing ; and committing no sin, they have no reason to be ashamed.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	267	Besides, they kill no living creature, neither fly nor flea, nor hog nor worm, considering they have souls.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	268	They will sleep on the earth without any covering, whence it is a great wonder they do not die, much more that they enjoy so long a life.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	269	They fast the whole year round, drinking only water.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	270	Some reside in the monastery to serve the gods; but before admission they undergo the following trial.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	271	The young girls offered to the idols caress these new candidates, and endeavour variously to entertain them.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	272	Such as appear to take any pleasure in these endearments, are rejected as unworthy ; but if they show themselves totally indifferent, they are then retained.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	273	Such are the customs of these cruel and perfidious idolaters, who burn the bodies of their dead, because otherwise they would breed worms, which after eating the flesh would starve, and thus involve in great sin the soul to which the body belonged.
3	part3	23	Lar ; the Bramins	274	But I willnow cease saying any more about them.

3	part3	24	City of Cail	283	When the sons see this great piety in their mother, they feel themselves bound to make peace.

3	part3	24	City of Cail	290	His majesty furnishes him with a sword and small shield ; and all the people assemble as spectators of the conflict, which is only terminated by the death of one of the parties.
3	part3	24	City of Cail	291	They are not, however, allowed to strike with the point of the sword.

3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	317	Pepper grows in great abundance, and there isa considerable produce of ginger and other spices.
3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	318	The king is very rich, but not powerful in men; yet his dominions have such strong approaches, that he has no dread of invasion.
3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	319	If any vessel destined for another port is driven hither by stress of weather, the people seize and possess themselves of all its cargo, saying, “You were going to another place, but God sends you and yourstome”.
3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	320	In this they think themselves quite guiltless.
3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	321	Ships come from Manji and other parts in the summer, load in eight days, and depart as soon as possible, there being no port, but dangerous sandbanks.
3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	322	Those of Manji are least apprehensive, being provided with large wooden anchors.
3	part3	27	Eli or Dely	323	There are here lions and other wild beasts, with good hunting.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	324	Melibar is a great kingdom towards the westward, with a sovereign and languages of its own.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	325	The people are idolaters, and subject to no foreigner.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	326	Here the northstar, at its greatest height, appears two cubits above the water.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	327	From this and an adjacent province named Gozurat, there issue annually a body of upwards of a hundred vessels, who capture other ships and plunder the merchants.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	328	Being sea-robbers, they carry with them their wives and children, and remain together all the summer, doing great injury to trade.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	329	These wicked corsairs form what they call a ladder on the sea ; twenty of them place themselves five miles from each other, and thus command a hundred miles in extent.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	330	When a merchantman comes in view, a light is kindled, which is repeated by one after another; so that no vessel sailing here can escape them.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	331	The mariners, however, knowing well their wicked customs, come well armed and prepared, and fight a desperate battle, often beating them off with loss ; but at other times fall into their hands.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	332	The pirates then take the ship with all the goods, but do no injury to the men, saying to them, “ Go and collect another cargo, that we may have a chance of getting it too”.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	333	In this country is a vast abundance of pepper, and also of ginger, with a good supply of cinnamon and other spices, also cubebs and cocoa-nuts.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	334	Cotton cloths, the most beautiful and delicate in the whole world, are here manufactured, with other valuable articles.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	335	t To purchase these goods, the merchants from other quarters bring copper, which they use as ballast ; cloths of silk and gold, sandal-wood, and other spices.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	336	Ships come even from the great province of Manji; and the dealers here convey the goods to various quarters in the west, whence the most valuable are forwarded to Alexandria.
3	part3	28	Melibar or Malabar	337	Having told you now of Melibar, we shall go to Gozurat, but it would be too tedious to inform you of all the cities of these countries, they are so very numerous.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	338	Gozurat, too, is a great kingdom to the west, having languages and a king of its own, and subject to no other.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	339	Here the north-star rises to the apparent height of six cubits.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	340	The greatest pirates in the world live here, and have a most wicked custom ; after taking a merchant, they make him drink tamarinds and sea-water, then examine carefully if he voids any pearls or precious stones, which are alleged to be usually swallowed on such emergencies.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	341	There is in this land a great quantity of pepper and indigo, with a good deal of ginger.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	342	Cotton also abounds, and the trees which bear it, when twenty years old, rise to the height of six paces; but the produce is then unfit to be spun, and can only be used for quilting.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	343	Before twelve years, it is well fitted for the former purpose.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	344	"t An immense quantity of ""dressed leather is prepared from the skins of the goat, the buffalo, the wild ox, unicorn, and various other animals, and it is largely exported to Arabia and adjoining regions."
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	345	Coverlets of red leather are also framed, with representations of birds and beasts, most delicately interwoven with gold and silver thread.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	346	They are wonderfally beautiful, and being used by the Saracens for sleeping upon, are worth ten mares of silver.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	347	There are also cushions woven with gold, valued atten marcs.
3	part3	29	Kingdom of Gozurat	348	In short, this leather is embroidered for royal use, more delicately than in any other part of the world.
3	part3	3	Idolatry and Cruelty of the Japanese	349	The idolaters of Cathay, of Manji, and of these isles, have all a uniform worship ; their idols have heads respectively of the dog, the hog, the sheep, and various other animals, Some have a head and four faces, others three heads, one in the proper place, and one on each shoulder.
3	part3	3	Idolatry and Cruelty of the Japanese	350	Certain images have four, ten, and even a thousand hands, and these last are held in peculiar reverence.
3	part3	3	Idolatry and Cruelty of the Japanese	351	"‘When the Christians ask them why they form idols in so strange a manner, they reply,—""Our ancestors left them to us, and we will leave them to our children”."
3	part3	3	Idolatry and Cruelty of the Japanese	352	The actions of these beings are so various and diabolical, that they must not be mentioned in this book, because it would be a wicked thing in Christians to read them.
3	part3	3	Idolatry and Cruelty of the Japanese	353	I shall only mention, that any idolater of these isles, when he captures an enemy, who cannot procure a ransom in money, invites his friends, who cook and eat the prisoner, reckoning his flesh the most delicate food that can be obtained.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	354	Tana is a great kingdom in the west ; the inhabitants idolaters, with a language of their own, under a sovereign subject to no other.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	355	It does not produce pepper, or such spices as the other provinces ; but yields incense, not white, but of a brown colour.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	356	t There is a great trade in leather finely dressed, also in good cotton, both raw and made into cloth.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	357	The merchants import gold, silver, brass, and other goods necessary for these kingdoms, receiving various articles in return.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	358	But I have a bad thing to tell you ; for many pirates issue hence, scouring the sea, and greatly injuring the sailors; and the king sanctions their conduct, having made an agreement, that they bring to him all the horses captured, which are very numerous, being in great request over all India.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	359	But gold, silver, precious stones, and the rest of the cargo, belong to themselves.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	360	Now this is bad and very unjust conduct.
3	part3	30	Tana (Bombay)	361	Let us leave this country and speak of Cambaia.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	362	This is a great kingdom to the west ; the people idolaters, with a language of their own, and a ruler subject to no other.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	363	Here the north-star appears more fully, as it always does the farther you go westward.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	364	This region is rich and productive, particularly in excellent indigo; also cotton, both raw and manufactured, which is exported to many other countries.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	365	I may add, many hides are dressed, and worked with a skill nowhere surpassed ; also other articles too tedious to enumerate.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	366	The foreign merchants bring mostly gold, silver, and brass.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	367	The people are not pirates, but honest ; living by trade and manufacture.
3	part3	31	Kingdom of Cambais	368	And now I will tell you of Semenat.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	369	This is a great country to the westward.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	370	The inhabitants are idolaters, with languages of their own, and @ monarch subject to no other.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	371	They are not pirates, but live by trade and industry, as good men ought to do.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	372	‘The country is rich, and frequented by many merchants.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	373	The people, however, are fierce and cruel idolaters.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	374	Kesmacoran is a kingdom with a sovereign and languages of itsown.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	375	The people are idolaters, and raise abundance of rice, on which and on flesh and milk they subsist.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	376	There is a great trade by sea and land, but nothing else worth mentioning.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	377	Now this is the last province found in India, in proceeding between west and north-west ; and all the kingdoms already described, from Maabar to this, belong to that India which is called the Greater, and is the first of any in the world.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	378	I have, however, only mentioned those on the seacoast, since to treat of the inland ones would have been too tedious.
3	part3	32	Kingdom of Semenat (Sumnaut)	379	I shall therefore proceed to notice certain islands, also belonging to India, and first two called Male and Female.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	380	The isle called Male is full 500 miles out at sea, south of Kesmacoran.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	381	The people are baptized Christians, attached to the law and customs of the Old Testament ; they are very reserved in their intercourse with their wives.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	382	All the latter, indeed, dwell in another isle which is called Female.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	383	The men go and reside there three months in the year—March, April, and May—when they return to their own residence, and spend the remaining nine months in labour.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	384	In this isle is found very fine and beautifulamber.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	385	The people live on rice, milk, and flesh, and excel in fishing, capturing enough both for their own food and for exportation.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	386	They have no ruler except a bishop subject to the Archbishop of Scotra, and have languages of their own.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	387	The isle where their wives reside is thirty miles distant ; but they could not live if they spent the whole year with them.
3	part3	33	Islands called Male and Female	388	The sons remain with their mothers till the of fourteen, when they go to join their fathers in their separate abode.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	389	About 500 miles south from these isles you find that of Scotra, the people of which are baptized Christians, and have an archbishop.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	390	Ambergris is very plentiful, being voided from the entrails of whales, which are pursued most actively, in order to obtain this precious article.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	391	They strike into the animal a barbed iron 80 firmly that it cannot be drawn out.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	392	A long line attached enables them to discover the place where the dead fish lies, and drag it to the shore, when they extract from its belly the ambergris, and from its head several casks of oil.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	393	Fine cotton cloth is made; and abundance of good salt fish prepared.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	394	The people subsist on rice, milk, and flesh; and go naked after the manner of the other idolatrous Indians.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	395	To this island come many ships and merchants ; and indeed all those destined for Aden touch there.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	396	The archbishop has no connexion with the See of Rome, but is subject to a primate resident at Bagdad, who appoints him, as well as sends mandates to bishops and prelates in other quarters of the world.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	397	Hither, too, repair many corsairs with their ships, to sell their booty, and find a ready market, because the Christians, knowing it to have been abstracted from idolaters and Saracens, scruple not to purchase.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	398	They perform many other marvellous enchantments, which it would be wrong to relate; they would excite such amazement.
3	part3	34	Isle of Socotra	399	We shall therefore leave them, and describe the island of Madagascar.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	400	This is an island towards the south, about a thousand miles from Scotra.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	401	The people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed ; and they have four sheiks, or old men, who rule the entirecountry.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	402	This is really one of the noblest and greatest islands in the world, being reputed 4000 miles in circuit.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	403	In no region are so many elephants bred, and their teeth sold, as here and in Zanghibar.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	404	No flesh is eaten but that of camels, of which an incredible number are killed every day ; and being supposed better and more wholesome than any other, it is used if possible during the whole year.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	405	t The red sandal grows here to the height of our forest trees, and is sold with advantage to foreigners.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	406	Ambergris also abounds, from the number of whales which, as you know, yield that substance.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	407	There are leopards, ounces, and lions ; likewise various other animals, such as stags, wild goats, and deer, some of great size.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	408	The birds are equally various, several wonderfully different from ours.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	409	Many ships arrive with abundance of goods, as cloths of silk and gold, which are profitably exchanged for those of the country.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	410	Mariners, however, cannot reach the other islands lying south of this and of Zanghibar, owing to the violence of the current running in this direction.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	411	It is such, that while vessels can come hither from Malabar in twenty days, they spend three months in returning.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	412	Now I must mention, that in these southern isles, the birds called griffon are reported to exist, and to appear at certain seasons ; yet they are not formed as we describe and paint them, half-bird, half-lion, but exactly like the eagle, only immeasurably larger.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	413	They are represented so huge and powerful, as to take up the elephant and carry him high into the air, then let him drop, whereby he is at once killed, and they feed upon his carcass.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	414	It is asserted that their wings are twelve paces long, and when spread out, extend thirty paces across ; they are thick in proportion.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	415	I must add, that the khan sent messengers to obtain information about the country, and also the release of one of his subjects who had been made prisoner.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	416	They and the captive related to him many great wonders of these strange isles, and brought teeth of a wild boar, inconeeivably large: I assure you, he found them to weigh fourteen pounds.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	417	You may thus judge as to the size of the boar ; and indeed some are equal to a buffalo.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	418	There are also giraffes and wild asses, and other beasts and birds wonderfully different from ours.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	419	To return to the griffon; the people .
3	part3	35	Madagascar	420	of the island do not know it by that name, but call it always ruc; but we, from their extraordinary size, certainly conclude them to be griffons.
3	part3	35	Madagascar	421	Having nothing more to tell of this island, I will go on to that of Zanghibar.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	422	This is a very great and noble island, about 2000 miles in circuit.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	423	The people are all idolaters, have languages and a king of their own, and are subject to no other power.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	424	They are not very tall, but so broad and thick, that in this respect they appear like giants ; and they are likewise immensely strong, bearing as large a burden as four other men, which is really no wonder, for they eat as much as five.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	425	They are perfectly black, and go naked, with the exception of a cloth round the waist.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	426	Their mouth is so wide, their nose so turned up, their lips and eyes so big, that they are horrible to behold,and any one meeting them in another country would believe them devils.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	427	Elephants abound, and a great traffic is carried on in their teeth ; likewise lions of a peculiar species, with ounces and leopards.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	428	In short, they have all kinds of beasts different from others in.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	429	the world ; including sheep entirely white, with only the head black, and none of any other colour.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	430	Here too is the giraffe, a most beautiful creature, whose shape I will describe.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	431	Behind, it is low, and the legs very short ; while those before, and the neck, are very large, so that its head rises three paces from the ground.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	432	The animal is small, and is quite harmless; and its colour being red and white, in circles, it is very beautiful.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	433	t But there is a thing which I had forgotten about the elephant, that it caresses the female in the same manner as the human species.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	434	I must say, the women of this island are most ugly objects; with large mouth, eyes, and nose, and their breasts four times the ordinary size; in short, they are hideous.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	435	The people live on rice, flesh, milk, and dates, and though they have no vines, make a very good liquor of rice, sugar, and spices.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	436	There is a great trade, particularly in elephants’ teeth; and a good quantity of amber.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	437	The men are very brave in combat, and have little fear of death.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	438	They have no horses, but fight upon camels and elephants, placing on them castles well covered, with sixteen or twenty men mounted on them, bearing lances, swords, and staves, and making a very powerful force in battle.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	439	They have no arms except leathern shields, lances, and swords, with which they fight well.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	440	When leading the elephant to the combat, they give him to drink of their wine or liquor, which renders him more -fierce and effective.
3	part3	36	Coast of Zanghibar	441	I must now proceed to the great province of Abascia, but first wish to say something more of India in general.
3	part3	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	442	You must know I have described only its noblest Kingdoms and isles; those that make the flower of the region, and to which the rest are mostly subject.
3	part3	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	443	No man could enumerate all the islands ; they are estimated at 12,700, inhabited and uninhabited, according to the writings of the most skilful mariners.
3	part3	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	444	In the Greater India, which extends from Maabar to Kesmacoran, are thirteen very great kingdoms, of which I have described ten.
3	part3	37	The Islands in the Indian Sea	445	The Lesser India, stretching from Zinaba to Montifi, contains eight, and this is exclusive of numerous others that are in the islands.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	446	Abascia is a very great province, called the Middle India.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	447	The supreme monarch isa Christian ; the other six kings are subject to him, three being believers, and three Saracen.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	448	The christian people of this province have three marks upon their face, one from the forehead to the middle of the nose, and one on each cheek, made with a hot iron, and herein consists their baptism.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	449	There are also Jews having a mark on each cheek, and Saracens with only one on the forehead and nose.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	450	* The great king lives in the middle of the province; the Saracens towards Aden.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	451	In this district Messer St Thomas the apostle preached, and after converting the inhabitants, went to Maabar, where he died, and his body remains, as formerly mentioned.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	452	This country contains many good men-at-arms and well mounted cavalry, who are much needed; for wars are frequent with the Sultans of‘Adent and Nubia, and with other powers.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	453	But I will tell you a memorable story of what happened in the year 1288.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	454	This king, who is lord over all Abascia, wished to go in pilgrimage to adore the sepulchre of Christ in Jerusalem.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	455	The barons represented the danger of the journey, and advised him to send a bishop or some other great prelate.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	456	The monarch having agreed, one of very holy life was chosen, who readily undertook the mission.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	457	He was equipped most handsomely as a pilgrim, and travelled by land and sea till he arrived at Jerusalem.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	458	Repairing to the sepulchre, he performed the due homage before an object so exalted; and having presented great offerings from the king, and well fulfilled his mission, he set out on his return.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	459	He passed through Aden, a country where Christians are hated as mortal enemies.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	460	The governor, learning that he professed this religion, and was a messenger of the sovereign of Abascia, warned him, that unless he embraced the law of Mohammed, he would suffer a shameful punishment.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	461	The bishop replied, that he would sooner die.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	462	The other, greatly enraged, ordered him to be forcibly circumcised, and then sent him away, telling him that this was meant as an affront to his master.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	463	The prelate was much grieved, but consoled himself by thinking that he had suffered for the law of his faith, and God would recompense him in the other world.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	464	As soon as he could travel, he proceeded to Abascia, and appeared before the king; who, having inquired about the sepulchre, and being told the whole truth, accounted it a most holy and pious visit.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	465	The bishop then related the affront put upon him by the ruler of Aden, when his majesty fell into such a transport of grief and rage, that he almost died.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	466	He called aloud in the hearing of all the bystanders, that he would never wear a crown, nor rule a province, till he had taken such vengeance as should be spoken of throughout the world.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	467	Presently he prepared a vast body of troops, on horseback and foot, also elephants with well-armed castles, having twenty men upon each.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	468	He then set out and marched directly onward to the territory of Aden.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	469	Its chiefs, with a great multitude of Saracens on foot and horseback, came to defend their country, and a most obstinate battle was fought ; but the enemy could not withstand the force of the King of Abascia, because the Christians are more valiant.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	470	They ficd and were slain in great numbers.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	471	The victor, entering the country in three or four places, greatly wasted and destroyed it, killing many of the inhabitants.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	472	He then thought the affront sufficiently avenged; and indeed I must tell you he could effect no farther devastation, the region being extensive, and full of dangerous passes, where a few men could greatly harass an army.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	473	I will now relate other matters of Abascia, which yields a great variety of all things necessary for subsistence.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	474	The people live on rice, flesh, milk, and sesamum, and have elephants, not bred there, but brought from the isle of the other India.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	475	Giraffes, however, are in great numbers ; also lions, leopards, ounces, wild apes, and many beasts and birds different from ours, The domestic fowls are the most beautiful in the world ; and the ostriches as large as asses.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	476	They have parrots, beautiful and various ; also monkeys and cats of two species, with faces exactly like those of men.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	477	This Abascia contains numerous cities and castles, and is much frequented by merchants; many cloths of cotton and buckram are wrought there.
3	part3	38	Kingdom of Absscia	478	I might relate other things, but must now go on to the province of Aden.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	479	This country is subject to a lord, called sultan.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	480	The people are all Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and wishing the greatest mischief to Christians.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	481	‘There are many cities and castles; for Aden is the port to which the Indian ships bring all their merchandise.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	482	It is then placed on board other small vessels, which ascend a river about seven days, at the end of which it is disembarked, laden on camels, and conveyed thirty days farther.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	483	It then comes to the river of Alexandria, and is conveyed down to that city.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	484	By this route alone its inhabitants receive their pepper, spices, and costly goods.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	485	* From Aden, too, ships sail for India with various goods, especially very fine and valuable horses, which, as you know, are sold there for full a hundred marks of silver.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	486	The sultan draws a great revenue from the duties on these cargoes ; and is thus one of the richest princes in the world.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	487	But, I assure you, he did great injury to the Christians ; for when the governor of Babylonia attacked and took the city of Acre, committing much devastation, he was assisted by this prince with 30,000 horses and 40,000 camels.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	488	This aid was given rather out of hatred to believers than good-will to that prince.
3	part3	39	City and Kingdom of Aden	489	But now I will tell you of another great city.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	490	You must know, that the gulf containing this island is called that of Zin, meaning in their language the sea opposite to Manji.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	491	According to skilful and intelligent mariners, who have made the voyage, it contains 7448 isles, mostly inhabited.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	492	In all these there grows no tree which is not agreeably fragrant, and also useful, being equal or superior in size to the lignum aloes.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	493	They produce also many and various spices, including pepper white like snow, as well as the black.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	494	They yield also much gold, and various other wonderful and costly productions ;but they are very distant and difficult to reach.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	495	The mariners of Zai-tun and Kin-sai, who visit them, gain indeed great profits; but they spend a year on the voyage, going in winter, and returning in the summer ; for the wind in these seasons blows only from two different quarters, one of which carries them thither, and the other brings them back.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	496	But this country is immensely distant from India.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	497	You may observe, too, that though the sea be called Zin, it is really the ocean, just as we say the sea of England, the sea of Rochelle.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	498	The great khan has no power over these islands.
3	part3	4	Sea of China, and numerous Islands	499	Now let us return to Zai-tun, and resume our narrative.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	500	Escier is a very large town to the north-west (north), four hundred miles from Aden.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	501	A count here rules with justice, but subject to the soldan of Aden ; and the people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	502	‘The port is good, frequented by many ships and merchants from India, who bring various commodities, and carry away others, particularly horses of great value, and yielding large profit.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	503	In this province grows a great quantity of fine incense, also of dates.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	504	They have no grain except rice, and little of that ; hence corn is profitably imported from other countries, Fish is caught in sach plenty, that for a Venetian gros you may purchase two large tunnies.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	505	The people live on rice, flesh, and fish, and have no wine except what they make from sugar, rice, and dates.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	506	But I must tell you, too, that they have sheep without ears, or any opening for them ; but where the ears should be, is a little horn; these are small and very beautiful creatures.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	507	Another thing you will much wonder at is, that all the animals, sheep, oxen, and camels, eat fish, because there is no grass, for it is the most arid place in the world.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	508	These fishes are very small, caught in March, April, and May, in wonderful quantities.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	509	They are dried, lodged in houses, and given as food to the animals during the whole year.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	510	The people eat them also when quite alive and newly taken.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	511	There are also plenty of large ones, which being made into a kind of biscuit, by cutting them into small pieces and drying them in the sun, are preserved under cover during the whole year.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	512	* The incense, mentioned as so abundant, is purchased by their lord at ten golden bezants the cantar, and retailed to the merchants for forty, so that he makes a very large profit.
3	part3	40	City of Escier (Shaher)	513	Let us now leave this city, and tell you of Dufar.
3	part3	41	City of Dufar	514	This is a beautiful, large, and noble city, 500 miles south-west from Escier.
3	part3	41	City of Dufar	515	The people are Saracens, adoring Mohammed, and ruled by a count, who is subject to Aden, to which, indeed, this city belongs.
3	part3	41	City of Dufar	516	The port is very good, and merchants convey thence many very fine Arabian horses, Numerous cities and castles depend upon it, and the country yields much incense.
3	part3	41	City of Dufar	517	The trees are about the size of a small fir, and incisions are made with knives in various places, whence flows the incense, which, indeed, through the great heat, often runs out of itself.
3	part3	41	City of Dufar	518	I shall now proceed to relate of the Gulf of Calatu.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	519	Calatu is a large city within the gulf of the same name, six hundred miles north-west from Dufar.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	520	It is a noble seaport, inhabited by Saracens, who are subject to Cormos.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	521	When the melik of that city is at war with a more powerful prince, he retires to this place, which is strong by nature and art, and finds himself secure.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	522	The people have no grain but what they import.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	523	Many ships bring the goods and spices of India, which are distributed throughout the interior, and many fine horses sent in return.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	524	But I must observe, that this city is at the mouth of the Gulf of Calatu, so that the melik can prevent vessels from sailing in or out without hisconsent.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	525	This power he often uses against the sultan of Creman ; for when that prince demands any exorbitant tribute from him or other vassals, they remove from Cormos to Calatu, and allow no ships to pass, whence the other prince suffers severely, and is obliged to abate his demands.
3	part3	42	Gulf and City of Calatu	526	The people of this country live on dates and salt fish, which are abundant ; but many rich men are well supplied with better food.
3	part3	43	Return to Cormos	527	After departing from Calatu, and sailing three hundred miles between north-west and north, you find the city of Cormos ;but if you take a direction from the former place between north-west and north, and sail five hundred miles, you come to Quis.
3	part3	43	Return to Cormos	528	However, we shall pass over this last place, and speak of Cormos, a large and noble capital, subject to a melik, who commands many townsand castles.
3	part3	43	Return to Cormos	529	The people are Saracens, and adore Mohammed.
3	part3	43	Return to Cormos	530	The heat is very great, on which account every house is provided with ventilators placed on the side whence the wind blows, which being thus admitted, renders the mansion tolerably cool.
3	part3	43	Return to Cormos	531	We gave an account of this place formerly, as well as of Quis and Creman, but have since made a circuit which brought us back to it.
3	part3	43	Return to Cormos	532	However, we will say no more, but proceed now to the description of Great Turkey.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	533	This country lies to the north-west as you go from Cormos to the river Gihon, extending towards the terTitory of the great khan.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	534	It is governed by a nephew (cousin) of his, named Kaidu, grandson of Ciagatai, brother to that monarch.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	535	He isa very powerful lord, ruling many cities and castles.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	536	His subjects are Tartars, very able combatants, much inured to fighting, and he does not obey the khan, but is rather at perpetual war with him.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	537	This is because Kaidu demanded constantly from that monarch a share of his conquests, particularly in Catai and Manji.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	538	The latter said he would willingly grant it to him, as to his other descendants, if he would come to his court and council whenever summoned.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	539	But the other, afraid to trust his uncle, offered to obey him where he was, but dreaded that if in his power he would be put to death.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	540	Hence arose this discord, and the khan drew his forces around the realm of Kaidu to guard against an invasion; yet that prince contrived to penetrate, and fought repeatedly with the armies of Kublai; for he could bring into the field 100,000 brave and skilful horsemen.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	541	He had with him also many lords of the imperial lineage.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	542	Each soldier carries to battle sixty arrows, thirty smaller for shooting, and thirty larger, pointed with heavy iron, to throw against the face or arms of the enemy, or cut the cords of his bow; and when they have discharged all these, they lay their hand on their swords, and strike most terrible blows.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	543	Now, in the year 1266, this king, with his cousin named Jesudar, assembled a very great army, and marched against two barons that were also his relations, but held their lands from the great khan.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	544	Kaidu and his cousin fought with these two chiefs, who had also a very large force, so that between them there were 100,000 horsemen.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	545	They contended hardly and long, and many fell on both sides; but at last Kaidu conquered; however, the two barons, being well mounted, escaped without injury.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	546	The victor then became still more proud and boastful; yet he returned home and remained two years in peace.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	547	Then he assembled a mighty host of cavalry, having learned that at Karakorum there was a great army under Nomogan, a son of the khan, and George, a grandson of Prester John.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	548	He marched thither with all speed, and the two chiefs being informed of his approach, courageously prepared to meet him with their horsemen, amounting to upwards of 60,000.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	549	Having reached the place where his men were ranged in tents on the plain, they skilfully established their own camp.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	550	Each party rested and made preparations for three days, when they advanced to the combat.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	551	There was little advantage on either side ; both having about 60,000 mounted men well armed at every point, divided into six squadrons of 10,000.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	552	They waited only till they heard their lord sound the maccar ; meantime performing loudly on various musical instruments.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	553	At length the signal was given, when the hosts rushed against each other, laying their hands on their bows.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	554	The arrows filled the air like rain; men and horses were mortally wounded ; noise and cries arose so loud that the thunder of Jove could not have been heard.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	555	Truly this was an evil hour for many, who on both sides fell dead and dying.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	556	The arrows being discharged, they rushed on with sword and spear, giving and receiving most dreadful blows.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	557	You might see arms and hands cut off, and numbers of men rolling senseless on the earth.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	558	Kaidu displayed signal prowess, and his soldiers would have often been driven off the field, had he not encouraged and rallied them.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	559	On the other side, the two princes also firmly stood their ground, and it really was one of the most cruel battles ever fought between Tartar tribes.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	560	Yet though each strove with all his might to discomfit the other, neither could succeed, and the conflict lasted tillevening.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	561	On this fatal day, multitudes of men fell, many wives were made widows, children made orphans, and households filled with tears and lamentations.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	562	But when the sun set, the struggle could endure no longer, and both parties returned to their camp overpowered with fatigue, happy to rest during the night.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	563	When morning dawned, King Kaidu, having received intelligence that the great khan was marching against him with a mighty host, deemed it unsafe to remain longer.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	564	Wherefore he and all his men mounted and rode off to their own country ; the two princes were so exhausted, that they did not attempt to follow, so that he with his people reached Samarcand, the capital of his kingdom.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	565	The great khan felt much wrath at Kaidu for committing such ravages, and bethought himself, that had he not been his nephew, he would have seized his land and put him to a cruel death; but regard to his own flesh restrained him.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	566	Thus he escaped out of the hand of the mighty monarch.
3	part3	44	Turkestan—Wars of Kaidu	567	But I have wonderful stories to tell you about a daughter of this prince.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	568	This young lady was in Tartar named Aigiarm, which means in our language “ brilliant moon”.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	569	She such strength that none of the youths or nobles in the whole kingdom could vanquish her, but were all beaten.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	570	Her father wished to marry her to a baron; but she refused ever to unite herself to any one who could not vanquish her in fair combat; and the king granted her this privilege.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	571	She rejoiced greatly, and published through various parts of the world, that if any gentle youth would come, try her in pitched battle, and gain the victory, she would accept him for her lord.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	572	This news was spread wide through the surrounding countries, and I assure you many gentlemen came and made the trial, which was arranged in the following manner.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	573	The king, with many young nobles and ladies, assembled in the great hall of the palace, when the princess entered in a robe of cotton richly adorned, attended by youths similarly attired.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	574	The agreement was, that if the candidate prevailed and threw her to the ground, he should have her for his wife; but if victory declared on her side, he was to give her a hundred horses.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	575	Thus she had gained above ten thousand steeds, because she could find no youth or damosel that could overcome her ; nor was this wonderful, for she was large, tall, and wellformed in her limbs, indeed almost a giantess.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	576	Now, about the year 1280, there came the son of a rich king, an extremely handsome young man, with a brilliant retinue and a thousand very fine horses.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	577	He addressed himself to Kaidu, who was very desirous of marrying him to his daughter.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	578	He therefore caused her to be privately dealt with, to allow herself to be conquered; but she declared she would not do so for any thing in the world.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	579	One day then, the king and queen, with many nobles and ladies, assembled in the great hall; the princess and prince then entered, and their handsome appearance struck all with wonder; he was really so strong and powerful, that no one else could contend with him.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	580	When they were in the middle of the hall before this great assembly, the agreement was formally made, that the suitor, if vanquished, should lose his thousand horses.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	581	But all the company, as well as the king and queen, expressed their wishes that he should be successful.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	582	The two then rushed together, and wrestled violently, dragging each other in different directions: but at last the lady prevailed, and threw him on the ground, to the great grief of all the spectators; he thus forfeited the thousand horses.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	583	But I have to inform you, that Kaidu led this daughter to many battles, and in no encounter could any warrior withstand her.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	584	On many orrasions, she rushed among the enemy, seized one of the chiefs, and dragged him over to her own army.
3	part3	45	Exploits of a Tartar Princess, Daughter to Kaidu	585	I will now, however, proceed to a great battle fought between her father and Argon, the son of Abaga, lord of the East.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	586	Abaga ruled many provinces bordering on those of Kaidu, and it was where grows the tree called in the book of Alexander the Arbor Secco.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	587	As that prince committed great ravages on his territory, he sent his son Argon, with a very large host of cavalry, into the country of the Arbor Secco, to the river of Gihon, where he took a station fitted to guard the country against the invader.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	588	Kaidu, however, assembled a great body of horsemen, and gave the command to a brother named Barak, very brave and skilful, desiring him to oppose the enemy.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	589	Barak, with his troops, rode on till they came to the river, and were ten miles distant from Argon.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	590	The latter, informed of the approach of his adversary, made diligent preparation ; the two remained three days in their respective camps.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	591	When they were fully prepared, and the naccar began to sound, they no longer delayed, but rushed furiously against each other.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	592	The arrows might be seen flying on all sides, and the air was so full of them, that it seemed to rain; and when both parties had discharged them, and many men as well as horses had been slain, they seized their swords and spears, and began a most fierce and cruel combat.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	593	Arms and legs were cut off, chargers killed, and many dreadful wounds inflicted ; the noise and cries were such as would have drowned the loudest thunder.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	594	I assure you, in a few hours the ground was covered with dead and dying.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	595	Finally, Barak and his men could not endure the force of their adversary, and retreated across the river ; while the victor pursued and killed a great number.
3	part3	46	Great Battle between Barak and Argon	596	Thus Argon gained the day ; and having begun to speak of him, I will relate his other adventures, and how he became sovereign lord after the death of Abaga, his father.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	597	Not long after Argon had gained this battle, he received news of the death of Abaga.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	598	He was much grieved, yet prepared with his whole host to return to the court, and take possession of the sovereignty ; but he had forty days to march before arriving there.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	599	Nowa brother of the deceased monarch, named Acomat Soldan, who had become a Saracen, having heard of the event, bethought himself, that since the heir was so distant, he himself might succeed.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	600	Having prepared a large body of men, he marched directly to the capital, and seized the supreme power.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	601	He found such an amount of treasure, that it could scarcely be counted.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	602	He lavished his bounty in a wonderful manner on the chiefs and barons, who declared him a good master, liked him, and wished for no other.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	603	He studied to be popular, and to please all men; yet the action he had committed was vile, and blamed by many.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	604	It was not long till he learned that Argon was marching against him with a very powerful force.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	605	He made no delay, nor showed surprise, but actively summoned his barons and troops ; and in a week he had assembled a numerous body of cavalry, who all marched cheerfully against Argon, expressing their earnest desire to kill or take him.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	606	Soldan Acomat having thus assembled 60,000 horsemen, set out and marched full ten days without interruption, when he learned that Argon, with an equal force, was five days’ journey distant.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	607	He pitched his camp and awaited the enemy in a large and beautiful plain, which seemed well adapted for the combat.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	608	He then summoned his people, and thus addressed them :— “ My lords, you know how well I am entitled to succeed my brother, being son of the same father, and having accompanied him in all his conquests.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	609	Because Argon is son to Abaga, some think he ought to succeed ; but with all due respect to them, I consider this unjust.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	610	Even during my brother’s life, I was reasonably entitled to half the kingdom, only through my mildness I allowed him the whole, but now I ought to succeed.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	611	I pray you then to defend my right against Argon, and preserve to us the rule; for I seek only the name and dignity, and leave to you the profit and possession of all.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	612	I need say no more to wise men, who love justice, and will do all things for the general honour and benefit”.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	613	‘When the barons, chiefs, and soldiers heard this speech, they declared with one consent their resolution to adhere to him while they had breath, and defend him against all, and particularly Argon, whom they trusted they would capture and place in his hands.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	614	When that prince learned that his rival was waiting for him with so great a multitude, he was much discomposed ; he considered, however, how injurious it would be to show melancholy or fear, and the necessity of displaying valourand boldness.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	615	He sent for his lords and counsellors, and having assembled a great number, thus addressed them :—“ My dear brothers and friends, you know well how tenderly my father loved you, regarding you while he lived as kindred and children ; also how many great battles you fought with him, aiding him to conquer all his kingdom.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	616	Now I am the son of him who loved you so much, and to me you are equally dear; I therefore trust you will aid me against the man who seeks, contrary to all right and reason, to disinherit me.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	617	Consider also, that he has forsaken our law and embraced that of Mohammed ; it were fitting indeed that a Saracen should rule over the Tartar nation!
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	618	Therefore, friends and brothers, I trust that you will willingly and heartily support me, and that each will display such valour, that the battle may be ours, and we may comfort ourselves by thinking that the right is on our side”.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	619	After this speech, each lord and chief thought to himself, that he ought rather to die than not strenuously endeavour to gain atriumph.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	620	While the rest were silent, one great lord arose and said :—‘“ Noble sire, we know fully the truth of what you have said, and I will now answer in the name of all now present, that while life remains in our bodies, we are ready to die rather than fail to conquer.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	621	Victory, too, appears to us certain, since we are so greatly in the right, and our enemies in the wrong.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	622	I advise, then, that we march as soon as possible against the foe, and pray all our companions to display such valour, that their deeds may be spoken of over the whole world”.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	623	That brave man having concluded, all present assented, and eagerly desired battle.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	624	Next morning, Argon and his troops began their march, riding towards the plain on which their enemies were posted, and pitched their camp ten miles distant from that of Acomat.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	625	Argon now chose two intelligent men, in whom he greatly confided, and sent them to his uncle.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	626	They mounted on horseback, went direct, and alighted at the pavilion of the soldan, whom they found with a numerous company of barons.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	627	Being well acquainted, they saluted him courteously, and received a cheerful welcome.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	628	After some time, one of them rose and said,— “Noble sire, your nephew Argon wonders greatly at your seizing his kingdom, and coming thus to fight against him.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	629	This is not good conduct, nor due from an uncle towards a nephew; he therefore courteously prays you to abstain, and desiring neither war nor quarrel, will respect you as superior and father, both of himself and of the whole country”.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	630	Acomat answered,— ‘My lords messengers, my nephew is entirely mistaken ; the land is mine, I conquered it along with his father.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	631	If he will consent, I will make him a great lord, endowing him with spacious estates, treating him as my son and the highest under myself; otherwise, be assured, I will endeavour to put him to death”.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	632	The envoys then asked repeatedly, if they could hope for no other determination.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	633	He replied, never in his lifetime.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	634	They then departed, and rode to the camp of their lord, alighted at the tent, and told him his uncle’s declaration.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	635	Argon was greatly enraged, and said aloud in the hearing of all, that he would never live in comfort till the whole world had seen the signal vengeance he would take on his uncle.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	636	He said to his chiefs,—“ Now let us without further delay march against these traitors and endeavour to destroy them”.
3	part3	47	Argon and Acomat contend for the Persian Empire	637	The night was spent in busy preparation ; and Acomat Soldan, being warned by his spies, was equally active.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	638	Next day Argon, having made all his arrangements, advanced in good order; while his antagonist, not waiting his arrival, led on his troops to the encounter.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	639	They soon met, and the two great hosts, who had much desired the battle, rushed without delay against each other.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	640	Arrows flew like rain, chiefs fell to the ground, the air resounded with the cries and lamentations of the wounded and dying.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	641	Their arrows being exhausted, they rushed on with swords and spears; arms, hands, and heads were cut off, and the noise would have drowned the loudest thunder, In that day many brave men died, and many ladies were left disconsolate.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	642	Argon assuredly displayed great prowess, and set a gallant example ; but in vain,—fortune turned against him,—his men, compelled to flee, were pursued and slain in great numbers.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	643	.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	644	Among the fugitives, he himself was captured, when the pursuers stopped and returned with him to their camp, rejoicing beyond measure.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	645	Acomat caused him to be imprisoned and carefully guarded ; then, being of a voluptuous disposition, he returned to court to enjoy the society of his numerous and handsome wives.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	646	He instructed the commander of the host to guard the captive as himself, and return at leisure that his troops might not be fatigued.
3	part3	48	Great Battle between them	647	He then departed, while Argon remained in chains, and so grieved, that death appeared to him desirable.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	648	Now there was a great and aged Tartar baron, who felt much pity for the prisoner, and bethought him how wicked it was to keep their lord in this condition.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	649	He resolved, therefore, to attempt his deliverance.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	650	He argued to this effect with many other chiefs, who, esteeming his wisdom, and conscious that he spake the truth, entirely agreed with him.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	651	Then Boga, who had made the proposal, Elcidai, Togan, Tegana, Taga, Tiar Oulatai, and Samagar, all went to the tent of the captive prince.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	652	The first, asthe eldest and the leader, addressed him thus,—“ Noble prince, we are now fully sensible of having acted wickedly towards you, and have determined to return to the right path; we will therefore deliver and own you as justly our liege lord”.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	653	Argon, who thought they were mocking him, was both grieved and angry.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	654	“ My lords,” said he, “ you have done wrong enough in seizing your sovereign and making him a captive.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	655	Pray depart, and do not also make him a subject of mockery”.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	656	“ Illustrious prince,” said Boga, “ we positively speak the truth, and will make oath to it according to our law”.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	657	Then all the barons swore that they would obey him as their lord, while he in return bound himself in no degree to resent past wrongs, but hold each of them as dear as Abaga his father had done.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	658	They then freed him from his chains, and did homage to him.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	659	He now ordered them to discharge their arrows against the tent of the melic; and that chief, named Soldan, who was the first after Acomat, and the commander of the whole host, was quickly slain.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	660	Finding himself thus lord of all, he gave orders to march to the court, and was instantly obeyed.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	661	One day, thereafter, when Acomat was holding a splendid festival in his palace, a messenger came to him and said,—“ Sire, I bring you with regret unwelcome tidings ; the barons have delivered Argon, owned him as lord, and killed Soldan your faithful friend.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	662	They are coming now with their utmost speed to take and slay you”.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	663	He was then silent, but the other was completely amazed and terrified.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	664	However, as a bold and brave man, he ordered the messenger not to say a word to a living creature; then mounting on horseback, set out with a few trusty servants, to seek refuge with the Sultan of Babylon, leaving all in ignorance whither he had gone.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	665	After marching six days, he came to the only pass by which he could penetrate.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	666	The commander who guarded it knew him, and seeing him fleeing with only a few adherents, determined to seize him, Acomat entreated for mercy, and offered a great treasure as the price of liberty ; but the other, being greatly attached to Argon, replied that the wealth of the world would not prevent his placing him in his master’s hands.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	667	He prepared a large company, and set out with his captive, watching him so carefully as to make escape impossible.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	668	They rode on to the court, where Argon had arrived only three days before, and been much vexed to find that his uncle had escaped ; but when the guardian of the pass brought the fugitive before his presence, he felt the greatest possible joy.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	669	He received the latter sternly, telling him that he would meet with the treatment he deserved; and without asking any one’s advice, he commanded him to be led forth and slain, This mandate was speedily executed, and the body was thrown into a place where it was never seen more.
3	part3	49	Final Issue of the Contest	670	Thus have you heard the whole affair of Argon and of Acomat his uncle.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	671	On leaving that port, and sailing west and somewhat south-west 1500 miles, you reach a country named Cianba,which is very rich and extensive.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	672	The people are idolaters, have a language of their own, and 9 king, who pays tribute to the great khan, but only in fine elephants peculiar to the country.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	673	That monarch, seeking to subdue him, sent, in 1278, one of his barons with many men, horse and foot, who began to lay waste the country.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	674	The sovereign, who was very aged and much afraid of such powerful warriors, did not venture to engage them on the open plain, remaining secure in strong cities and fortresses ; but all the lands and houses were wasted and destroyed.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	675	Grieved at the desolation of the territory, he sent messengers, who said to the great khan, “ Sir, the King of Cianba salutes you as his liege lord, and states himself to be a man of great age, who has long preserved his kingdom in peace.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	676	He offers to be your vassal, and pay a liberal tribute in elephants, and beseeches that your baron and army will cease to ravage his kingdom”.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	677	The khan, having heard this message, took pity upon him, and ordered his general to withdraw, and conquer another country ; and he has ever since received this tribute of the largest and most beautiful elephants.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	678	t In this kingdom, no handsome girl can be married till the king sees her, when, if pleased, he takes her to wife ; otherwise, he gives her money, with which she can be married to a nobleman.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	679	In 1285, when I, Marco Polo, was there, the king had 326 sons and daughters, of whom 150 were men that could carry arms.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	680	Besides elephants, the country abounds in lignum aloes, and the wood called ebony,which is very black, used in making chess-boards and writingdesks.
3	part3	5	Of Cianba, and Expedition thither	681	I now proceed to a great island named Java.
3	part3	50	Reign of Argon	682	Argon was thus master of the palace andof the kingdom, and the barons from every quarter came to render him due homage and obedience.
3	part3	50	Reign of Argon	683	After governing some time, he sent Casan his son with 30,000 men, to the country of the Arbor Secco, there to guard and secure his land and people.
3	part3	50	Reign of Argon	684	Argon began his reign in the year 1286, after Acomat had ruled two years.
3	part3	50	Reign of Argon	685	The former, after holding the sceptre six years, died, not without strong suspicions of poison.
3	part3	51	Reign of Quiacatu	686	When Argon was dead, his uncle, named Quiacatu, brother to Abaga, immediately seized the throne, which was easily effected, as Casan was distant at the Arbor Secco.
3	part3	51	Reign of Quiacatu	687	The latter, when informed of these eyents, was much grieved at the death of his parent, and still more incensed at Quiacatu having seized his inheritance.
3	part3	51	Reign of Quiacatu	688	He was afraid, however, to march at once against him, but resolved, that at the proper time and place he would take as signal vengeance as his father had done on Acomat.
3	part3	51	Reign of Quiacatu	689	Thus Quiacatu obtained general obedience, except over the troops whom Casan immediately commanded.
3	part3	51	Reign of Quiacatu	690	He married the wife of Argon his nephew, and indulged largely in the pleasures of the seraglio.
3	part3	51	Reign of Quiacatu	691	At the end of two years, however, his death ensued, being occasioned by poison.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	692	Baidu, his uncle, and aChristian, then seized the sovereignty, and was generally obeyed, unless by Casan and hisarmy.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	693	The latter, on learning these things, regretted much that he had not been able to punish Quiacatu, but determined to take such vengeance on Baidu, that the world might admire it.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	694	He marched without delay against that chief, who, informed of his approach, assembled a great force, and marched ten days’ journey to meet him, when he encamped, and awaited his adversary, earnestly exhorting and encouraging his troops.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	695	In two days Casan came up, and immediately a battle began, most bloody and desperate ; but it was vain for Baidu to struggle, since, as soon as the contest commenced, many of his men went over and fought on the side of his opponent.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	696	He was accordingly discomfited, and killed.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	697	Casan, thus victorious, immediately marched to court and assumed the sovereignty, when all the barons paid him homage and obedience ; and this was in the year 1294.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	698	* Thus have you heard the whole train of affairs from Abaga down to Casan.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	699	You must likewise know that Alau, who conquered Bagdad, and was brother to Kublai, was ancestor to all the princes now named ; for he was the father of Abaga, grandfather of Argon, who was the parent of Casan, now reigning.
3	part3	52	Contest between Baidu and Ghazan	700	Having told you all about these Tartars of the East, I might go on to treat of Great Turkey ; but the truth is, I have done so already, mentioning all the acts of Kaidu, so that I have nothing more to say, and shall therefore now tell you of the provinces and people that lie to the northward.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	701	In this quarter isa king named Conci.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	702	He and all his people are Tartars, and adhere to the rudest and most brutal customs of that nation, never having changed since the time of Gengis Khan.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	703	They have a god of felt, named Nacigai, to whom they also give a wife, calling these two lords of the earth, who guard all their corn, beasts, and landed property ; and when they get any victuals, they anoint with them the mouth of these deities.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	704	The king is independent, being of the imperial lineage of Gengis, and a near relation of the great khan.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	705	He has neither cities nor castles, but his people reside in vast plains, diversified with valleys and mountains.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	706	They are very submissive to him, and he successfully studies to preserve among them peace and union.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	707	* They have no grain, but live on milk and cattle, which abound, including camels, horses, oxen, sheep, and other animals.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	708	There are also bears, white all over, and longer than twenty palms, with foxes, large and black ; likewise a great number of sables, whose costly skins I have mentioned as worth each a thousand bezants.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	709	The rats of Pharaoh are plentiful, and very large, affording food to the people during the whole summer.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	710	In short, all kinds of wild beasts abound in this savage and.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	711	trackless region.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	712	I must also mention, that this king has a country in which horses cannot travel, on account of the numerous lakes and fountains, and the quantity of ice and mud.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	713	This rugged tract extends thirteen days’ journey, and at the end of each is a post-house to accom modate the messengers, with about forty dogs, almost as large as asses, to convey them from one post to the other.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	714	As wheeled carriages cannot travel here, they employ sledges, so formed as to move over the surface without sinking ; such, indeed, as are used in this country to convey hay and straw when there is great rain and mud.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	715	On the sledge is spread a bear’s skin, whereon the messenger sits, and the dogs drag it direct to the following post.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	716	The guardian mounts a similar carriage, and guides him by the best and nearest way.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	717	At the next post, they find another relay of sledges and dogs, and the one which conveyed them returns.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	718	The men dwelling in this wild country are very expert hunters, capturing many precious little animals, such as sables, ermines, and black foxes, whose skins yield a large profit.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	719	They have engines so well contrived that no animal can escape.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	720	But owing to the extreme cold, all their habitations are under ground.
3	part3	53	Of Conci and his Northern Kingdom	721	Having nothing more to mention, we shall depart and treat of a place where there is perpetual twilight.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	722	You must know, that beyond this kingdom is a province called Obscurity, because there never appears either sun, moon, or star; but it is always dark, as with us during twilight.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	723	The people have no ruler, but live like brutes.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	724	The Tartars, however, make occasional in roads in the following manner:—They ride on mares that have just brought forth foals, which last are left at the border.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	725	They then traverse the country, plundering whatever they can find ; and when they wish to return, the mares, seeking to find their young, know the way better than the riders.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	726	The people are all hunters, and take.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	727	great numbers of sables, black foxes, and other animals with costly furs.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	728	Those on their frontier meet them at a fixed period, purchase these skins, and sell them elsewhere with an ample profit.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	729	These people are tall and well made, but pale and colourless.
3	part3	54	The Region of Obscurity	730	The territory borders on one side upon Great Russia, of which I shall now proceed to speak.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	731	Russia is a very great province towards the north, inhabited by Christians, who follow the Greek Church.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	732	They have languages of their own, and several kings.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	733	They are a very simple people, but extremely handsome, with a faircomplexion.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	734	The entrances and passes into it are very strong ; they own some small allegiance to the Tartar king of the West, named Toctai.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	735	The country yields few commodities, except an abundance of the furs already described, equal to any in the world.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	736	There are considerable silver mines.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	737	But now let us leave it, and describe the Greater Sea, with the provinces around.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	738	But first let me tell you of a province lying between north and north-west, and bordering on Russia, named Lac, inhabited by a mixture of Christians and Saracens, and subject to a king.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	739	The people carry on merchandise and manufactures, and have a vast variety also of valuable furs.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	740	t But now I must go back to Russia, and mention something that I had forgot.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	741	It is so very extensive as to reach the ocean, where are isles on which pilgrim-falcons and gerfalcons are found, and carried to various parts of the world.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	742	Now from Russia to Oroech is no great distance ; but the extreme cold renders the journey very difficult.
3	part3	55	Description of Russia and several adjacent Countries	743	This would be the time to speak of the Strait of Constantinople and the mouth of the Great Sea; but on considering that many others have written on the subject, we shall omit them, and proceed to treat of the Tartars of the West, and the lords by whom they are ruled.
3	part3	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	744	The first lord of these Tartars was Sain, a very great and powerful king.
3	part3	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	745	He conquered Russia, Comania, Alania, Lac, Mengiar, Zic, Gucia, and Gazaria.
3	part3	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	746	The inhabitants had all been Comanian ; but having no unity or connexion, lost their country, and were driven into various parts of the world, while those who remained became servants of this conqueror.
3	part3	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	747	After him reigned successively Patu, Barka, Mungletemur, Totamongur, and Toctai, the present sovereign.
3	part3	56	Succession of Western Tartar Princes	748	Having thus recounted the kings of the Western Tartars, I will now describe a great battle fought between Alau, lord of the East, and Barka, lord of the West, with the occasion which led to it.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	749	You must know that about the year 1261 there arose a great discord between these two monarchs.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	750	It was about a province on their respective frontier which each desired and would not yield, but resolved to seize it and see who would oppose him.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	751	Thereupon they declared war, summoned their respective subjects, and made the greatest preparation almost ever known.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	752	I assure you, in six months each had assembled full 300,000 horsemen, well provided with every warlike implement.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	753	Alau, lord of the East, then set out with all his troops, and having rode many days, reached a wide plain between the Iron Gates and the Sea of Sarain.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	754	There he pitched his camp, which, I have heard, contained many rich tents, and made a splendid appearance.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	755	Being here on the frontier, he resolved to wait, and see if Barka would come.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	756	That prince having completed his preparations, and learned the approach of his foe, without delay began his march.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	757	He rode on till he came to the great plain where his enemy was posted, and pitched his camp at ten miles’ distance.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	758	I declare to you, it was fully as beautiful as that of Alau, filled with tents and pavilions of cloth of gold.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	759	His army, too, was more numerous, amounting, without a lie, to 350,000 horsemen.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	760	They rested two days in their tents, when Barka thus addressed his men :—“ Noble chiefs, you know how, since coming to the sovereignty, I have loved you as brothers and sons; you have accompanied me in many great battles, and aided in conquering much territory.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	761	Alau, a great and powerful prince, proposes wrongfully to fight against us; but having the right on our side, we may confidently expect to conquer, especially since our army is more numerous.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	762	In this confidence, then, noble chiefs, and having come so far for battle, let us prepare in three days to engage, arranging so wisely, and displaying such valour, that our fame may spread over the world”.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	763	He was then silent ; and we must now return to his antagonist, who, when he heard of his adversary’s arrival with so great an army, assembled his principal men and said :—“ Noble brethren and friends, you have throughout all my life supported and aided me, enabling me to conquer in many battles; nor indeed ever fighting one in which we were not victorious.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	764	We have come here to combat the great Barka, who indeed has as many and even more troops ; but ours are braver, and I feel confident of victory.
3	part3	57	Dispute between Barka and Hoolaku	765	I rejoice, then, to hear by the spies, that he is coming to give us battle in three days, and I expect every one to be well prepared, with his accustomed bravery, rather to die on the field with honour, than to suffer disgrace and discomfiture”.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	766	On the appointed day Alau rose early, summoned his men to arms, and ranged them very skilfully in order of battle.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	767	He formed thirty squadrons, each containing 10,000 horsemen, making in all the number of 300,000, with able leaders and captains.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	768	By his order his squadrons then advanced at a moderate pace over the plain, till they arrived mid-way between the two camps, where they stopped and awaited the enemy.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	769	On the same morning, Barka similarly arranged his men, forming thirty-five squadrons of 10,000 each, with good officers and commanders.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	770	He then made his troops ride forward to within half a mile of the enemy, when they halted, and again proceeded till the hosts, being within two bow-shots of each other, stopped and arranged their squadrons.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	771	The plain was the largest and finest in all that country ; which, assuredly, was very necessary to afford a field of battle for such mighty armies, amounting to 650,000 men.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	772	Indeed Alau and Barka were the most powerful princes in the world, and were near relations too,—being both of the imperial lineage of Gengis Khan.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	773	The two great kings with all their troops being thus marshalled, impatiently waited for the naccar as a signal of battle.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	774	When it sounded, the armies rushed forward and discharged arrows against each other.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	775	The air was filled, and the sky became invisible; numbers of men and horses fell to the earth, which was covered with dead and dying.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	776	The arrows being exhausted, they struck dreadful blows with swords and spears ; assuredly there had not for a long time been a battle in the world fought by such numerous armies.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	777	Alau, most brave and powerful in arms, showed himself this day worthy of ruling a kingdom and wearing a crown.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	778	He displayed signal prowess in his own person, and by his example infused extraordinary courage into his men.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	779	His achievements, indeed, astonished both friends and enemies ; he appeared, not aman, but thunder and tempest.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	780	Barka, too, fought most bravely, and made himeelf worthy of the admiration of the whole world ; but it was all in vain ; his men were either killed, or so overwhelmed and exhausted, that they could endure no longer.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	781	When evening arrived, they fied with their utmost speed.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	782	The victor and his troops rapidly pursued, and after committing dreadful slaughter returned, threw aside their arms, and had their wounds washed and dressed.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	783	They were, indeed, quite overpowered and exhausted.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	784	The night was spent in repose, and next day he ordered all the dead bodies both of friends and enemies to be burned.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	785	He then returned into his country with all the troops who survived the battle; for I assure you, although he conquered, he had lost a vast number, yet still more had fallen on the opposite side.
3	part3	58	Great Battle between them	786	Having told you thus of Alau and his victory, we shall go on to treat of a battle between the Tartars of the west.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	787	You must know that in this quarter the great lord of the Tartars was named Mongutemur, and he was suoceeded by Tolobuga, a very young man.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	788	Tofimangu, a powerful chief, aided by a king named Nogai,killed that prince and succeeded to the sovereignty.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	789	He died, however, soon after, and in his room was elected Toctai, a very wise and able chief.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	790	Meantime, two sons of the slain monarch having grown up to manhood, and being wise and prudent, assembled a large body of troops, and marched to the court of Toctai.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	791	They went and threw themselves on their knees before him, when he bid them welcome, and desired them to rise.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	792	The two youths then stood up, when the eldest began to speak thus :— Noble sire, we come as sons of Totamangu, who was killed by Tolobuga and Nogai.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	793	The former being dead, we can say nothing ; but we seek vengeance on Nogai, and pray that you, as his rightful lord, make him appear and account for the death of our father”.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	794	The youth was then silent, and Toctai, feeling that he had spoken truth, replied,—* My noble friend, I will willingly do what you ask”.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	795	He then sent two messengers with this injunction to Nogai, who laughed at it, and positively refused to come.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	796	They rode back and reported this answer, when their master, much enraged, said in the hearing of all around him,—“ If God aid me, either Nogai shall obey my mandate, or I will march with all my men to destroy him”.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	797	"He then sent two other messengers, who rode to the court of the Tartar, presented themselves, and saluted him, He bid them welcome, when one of them said,—""Noble sire, Toctai gives warning, that unless you come to his court to account for your conduct to the sons of Totamangu, he will march against you with all his people, and do you all the injury in his power ; therefore be careful what you do in this business, and what message you send”."
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	798	"The other wrathfully replied,—""Gentlemen, return to your lord, and tell him from me, that I little dread the threatened war, and am ready to come and meet him half-way”."
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	799	The messengers, on hearing this speech, without delay set out, and rode till they came to their master, and told him all that Nogai had said.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	800	Seeing that war was inevitable, he immediately sent his messengers to all his subjects, and summoned them to prepare and march against his adversary.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	801	And what shall I say!
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	802	He assembled the greatest armament in the world.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	803	When the Tartar prince heard this, he also made great preparations ; but his people being less numerous, he could not assemble an equal army; however it was very powerful.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	804	When Toctai was fully ready to take the field, he set out, leading with him, I assure you, two hundred thousand horsemen.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	805	He rode on to the large and beautiful plain of Nerghi, and there pitched his camp.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	806	Hither also came the two sons of Totamangu, with a noble company of men, to avenge the death of their father.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	807	Now jet us turn to Nogai, who on learning his approach set.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	808	out with all his troops, and, without doubt, they were upwards of 150,000 horsemen, all good and valiant, better men at arms than those of the enemy.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	809	Two days after, he arrived and pitched his camp at ten miles distance.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	810	On both sides were seen very rich tents and pavilions of cloth of gold, fully displaying the wealth of these kings.
3	part3	59	Controversy beineet the Tartar Princes, Toctai and jogai	811	They then waited a short time on the plain for refreshment and repose.
3	part3	6	The Island of Java	812	Departing from Cianba, and going south and southeast 1500 miles, you come to this island.
3	part3	6	The Island of Java	813	Good mariners, who know it intimately, describe it as the largest in the world, with a circuit of more than 3000 miles, The people are subject to a powerful king, are idolaters, and pay no tribute to any other prince.
3	part3	6	The Island of Java	814	The territory is very rich, yielding pepper, nutmegs, galanga, cubebs, cloves, and all the richest of spices.
3	part3	6	The Island of Java	815	Many merchants from Zai-tun and Manji come and carry on a great and profitable traffic.
3	part3	6	The Island of Java	816	Its treasure also is so immense, that it can scarcely be estimated.
3	part3	6	The Island of Java	817	On account of the long and difficult navigation, the great khan never could acquire dominion over it.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	818	Toctar now assembled his people, and spoke as follows :—“ My lords, we have come to fight King Nogai, and with great reason, since all this feud and enmity have arisen from his not coming to account for his conduct to the sons of Totamangu.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	819	Since then his behaviour is thus unreasonable, we must feel good courage and hope of conquest ; and I earnestly pray that each man be valiant, and strive to carry destruction and death among the enemy”.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	820	"The other, too, thus addressed his men :— ""Noble friends and brethren, you know how many great and hard battles we have gained, and against better men than now oppose us; therefore you may feel assured of victory."
3	part3	60	Great Battle	821	Besides, we are fully in the right, and he in the wrong ; for, as you know well, he is not my lord, nor entitled to call me to his court to give an account to others, I say no more, but pray every one to perform such exploits, that the whole world may admire them, and your name may always strike terror”.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	822	The two kings, having thus spoken, made no delay in forming their order of battle.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	823	The first drew out twenty squadrons, and his enemy fifteen, of 10,000 men each, with good captains and conductors.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	824	Having rode on to within bow-shots, and the naccar having sounded, they rushed forward and discharged their arrows, when many horses and riders fell dead, loud cries arose, and tears were shed.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	825	Afterwards they all advanced with sword and spear ; hands, heads, and arms were cut off ; knights fell dead and wounded to the earth ; the cries, noise, and clashing of arms, would have drowned the loudest thunder.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	826	Never almost was there a battle in which such numbers fell ; but the greater loss was on the side of Toctai, for his adversary had better men-at-arms.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	827	The two sons of Totamangu displayed great prowess, striving to the utmost to avenge the death of their father; but it was in vain.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	828	The battle, in short, was most bloody and dreadful; many who in the morning were alive and vigorous, during the day fell slain, and many happy wives were made widows.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	829	Toctai strove with all his might to support his people and his honour, and displayed indeed a prowess worthy to be praised by the whole world.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	830	He rushed amid the enemy like one that cared nothing for life or death, striking to right and left, rescuing his people when seized or taken.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	831	He did much injury that day both to enemies and friends; of the one he killed a vast number, and the other, from his example, derived boldness to push against their foe, and thus met instant death.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	832	Nogai, on his side, equally acted the hero; he rushed among theenemy asthe lion does among other wild beasts, casting down and killing all whom he encountered.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	833	He threw himself among the thickest of the foe, and all fled before him like weak and timid animals.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	834	His troops emulated his valour ; but why make a long story !
3	part3	60	Great Battle	835	The people of Toctai did every thing possible to support their honour, though in vain, for they had too good and stout men to deal with.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	836	They had suffered so much as to make it evident that if they remained they would all perish.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	837	They therefore took to flight as quickly as they could, the victor with his troops pursuing and killing them in great numbers.
3	part3	60	Great Battle	838	Thus have you heard how Nogai gained the battle, and be assured there died in it 60,000 men ; but the other king escaped, as well as the two sons of Totamangu.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	839	You have now been informed of all the actions of the Tartars and Saracens, of their customs, and of other countries throughout the world, so far as they could be searched out and discovered.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	840	We have only declined saying any thing of the Black Sea and the surrounding provinces, although we fully explored them, because it would seemingly have been useless, and a repetition of what others relate every day.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	841	The Venetians, the Genoese, the Pisans, and many other nations, are continually navigating it, so that every one knows the bordering countries.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	842	You have been informed in a chapter at the beginning, of our departure from the great khan, and the trouble and solicitation which Maffio, Nicolo, and Marco had in obtaining his permission.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	843	You have learned also the accident whereby it was procured, without which we should have found it very difficult to return into our country.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	844	But I believe it was the pleasure of God, that they might make known the great things that are in the world, and, as formerly declared in the preface, there never was a man, either Christian or Saracen, or Tartar or Pagan, who explored so much of the world as did Marco, the son of Nicolo Polo, that noble and great citizen of Venice.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	845	Deo Gratias.
3	part3	61	Conclusion	846	Amen, Amen.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	847	Leaving this island, and sailing between south and south-west 700 miles, you find two isles, a large and a small, called Sondur and Condur.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	848	Departing thence, and going south-east still 500 miles, you find a very extensive province named Lochac.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	849	The people are subject only to a native king, are idolaters, with languages of their own.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	850	They are tributary to no power, being so situated that no invader can reach their land ; otherwise it would soon be subdued by the great khan.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	851	Brazilwood is in abundance, and gold in almost incredible quantities.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	852	There are elephants and other animals for hunting; and from this place is derived all the porcelain that is circulated as money through the provinces now described.
3	part3	7	Kingdom of Lochac	853	I have only to add, that the country is difficult to reach; the king himself does not wish to be visited by strangers, and thus no one knows his treasure and condition.
3	part3	8	Pentam and other Islands	854	When a man goes 500 miles southward from Lochac, he finds an island named Pentam, very wild, all covered with odoriferous woods.
3	part3	8	Pentam and other Islands	855	Thence he navigates between these two islands about sixty miles, drawing only four paces of water, so that large vessels in the passage must remove their: rudder.
3	part3	8	Pentam and other Islands	856	He then goes on south-east about thirty miles, and reaches an island also named Pentam, with the noble and rich city Malauir, having much traffic in spices and other articles.
3	part3	8	Pentam and other Islands	857	The people have a king and languages of their own.
3	part3	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	858	Departing from Pentam, and going 130-miles south-east, you find the island of Java the Lesser; but notwithstanding this title, it is above two thousand miles in circuit, with eight kingdoms, and the same number of crowned sovereigns.
3	part3	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	859	I will tell you the whole truth about it.
3	part3	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	860	The people are idolaters, and each nation has a language of its own.
3	part3	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	861	There is a very great abundance of treasure and costly spices, as well as of lignum aloes and many other woods unknown in our country.
3	part3	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	862	What will appear very wonderful is, that this isle lies so far south, that the north star is never seen.
3	part3	9	Island of Little Java (Sumatra)	863	Now I will tell you of each kingdom by itself.
