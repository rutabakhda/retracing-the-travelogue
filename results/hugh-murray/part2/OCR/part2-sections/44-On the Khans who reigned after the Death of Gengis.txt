After the death of Gengis, the next khan was Cui, the third Bacui, the fourth Alton, the fifth Mangou, the sixth Kublai,who is greater and more powerful than all the rest; for the other five together had not so much power as this Kublai ; nay, let me tell you, that all the emperors in the world, and all the Christian and Saracen kings, do not equal him, as is shown fully in our book. Now you must know that the great lords of the lineage of Gengis Khan are buried in a lofty mountain called Altai, and whenever the chief lords of the Tartars die, if it should be a hundred days’ journey distant, they must be conveyed thither to be interred. I will tell you another striking wonder ; that when the bodies of the khans are carried to these mountains, the conductors put to the sword all the men whom they meet on the road, saying, “ Go and serve the great lord in the other world ;” and they do the same to the horses, killing also for that purpose the best he has, You must know that when Mangou died, more than 20,000 men were slain, who had been met on the road when his body was removed to be buried.
